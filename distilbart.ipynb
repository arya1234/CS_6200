      "The spectrum of solar light at the Earth's surface is mostly spread across the visible and near-infrared ranges with a small part in the near-ultraviolet.\n",
      "Most of the world's population live in areas with insolation levels of 150–300 watts/m2, or 3.5–7.0 kWh/M2 per day.Solar radiation is absorbed by the Earth's land surface, oceans – which cover about 71% of the globe – and atmosphere.\n",
      "Warm air containing evaporated water from the oceans rises, causing atmospheric circulation or convection.\n",
      "When the air reaches a high altitude, where the temperature is low, water vapor condenses into clouds, which rain onto the Earth's surface, completing the water cycle.\n",
      "The latent heat of water condensation amplifies convection, producing atmospheric phenomena such as wind, cyclones and anticyclones.\n",
      "Sunlight absorbed by the oceans and land masses keeps the surface at an average temperature of 14 °C.\n",
      "The total solar energy absorbed by Earth's atmosphere, oceans and land masses is approximately 122 PW·year = 3,850,000 exajoules (EJ) per year.By photosynthesis, green plants convert solar energy into chemically stored energy, which produces food, wood and the biomass from which fossil fuels are derived.\n",
      "In 2002 (2019 ) this was more energy in one hour (one hour and 25 minutes ) than the world used in one year.\n",
      "Photosynthesis captures approximately 3,000 EJ per year in biomass.\n",
      "The potential solar energy that could be used by humans differs from the amount of solar energy present near the surface of the planet because factors such as geography, time variation, cloud cover and the land available to humans limit the amount that we can acquire.\n",
      "Solar technologies are characterized as either passive or active depending on the way they capture, convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world.In 2021, Carbon Tracker Initiative estimated the land area needed to generate all our energy from solar alone was 450,000 km2 — or about the same as the area of Sweden, or the areas of Morocco, or California (0.3% of the Earth's total land area).\n",
      "Although solar energy refers primarily to the use of solar radiation for practical ends, all renewable energies derive their energy either directly or indirectly from the Sun.\n",
      "Active solar techniques use photovoltaics, concentrated solar power, solar thermal collectors, pumps, and fans to convert sunlight into useful outputs.\n",
      "Passive solar techniques include selecting materials with favorable thermal properties, designing spaces that naturally circulate air, and referencing the position of a building to the Sun.\n",
      "Active solar technologies increase the supply of energy and are considered supply side technologies, while passive solar technologies reduce the need for alternate resources and are generally considered demand-side technologies.In 2000, the United Nations Development Programme, UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs and World Energy Council published an estimate of the potential solar energy that could be used by humans each year that took into account factors such as insolation, cloud cover, and the land that is usable by humans.\n",
      "The estimate found that solar energy has a global potential of 1,600 to 49,800 exajoules (4.4×1014 to 1.4×1016 kWh) per year (see table below).\n",
      "Solar thermal technologies can be used for water heating, space heating, space cooling and process heat generation.== Thermal energy ==\n",
      "In 1878, at the Universal Exposition in Paris, Augustin Mouchot successfully demonstrated a solar steam engine but could not continue development because of cheap coal and other factors.=== Early commercial adaptation ===\n",
      "In 1897, Frank Shuman, a US inventor and solar energy pioneer built a small demonstration solar engine that worked by reflecting solar energy onto square boxes filled with ether, which has a lower boiling point than water and were fitted internally with black pipes which in turn powered a steam engine.\n",
      "In 1908 Shuman formed the Sun Power Company with the intent of building larger solar power plants.\n",
      "He, along with his technical advisor A.S.E.\n",
      "Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether.\n",
      "Shuman then constructed a full-scale steam engine powered by low-pressure water, enabling him to patent the entire solar engine system by 1912.\n",
      "Shuman built the world's first solar thermal power station in Maadi, Egypt, between 1912 and 1913.\n",
      "His plant used parabolic troughs to power a 45–52 kilowatts (60–70 hp) engine that pumped more than 22,000 litres (4,800 imp gal; 5,800 US gal ) of water per minute from the Nile River to adjacent cotton fields.\n",
      "Although the outbreak of World War I and the discovery of cheap oil in the 1930s discouraged the advancement of solar energy, Shuman's vision and basic design were resurrected in the 1970s with a new wave of interest in solar thermal energy.\n",
      "In 1916 Shuman was quoted in the media advocating solar energy's utilization, saying:We have proved the commercial profit of sun power in the tropics and have more particularly proved that after our stores of oil and coal are exhausted the human race can receive unlimited power from the rays of the Sun.\n",
      "Solar hot water systems use sunlight to heat water.=== Water heating ===\n",
      "In middle geographical latitudes (between 40 degrees north and 40 degrees south), 60 to 70% of the domestic hot water use, with water temperatures up to 60 °C (140 °F), can be provided by solar heating systems.\n",
      "As of 2015 the total installed capacity of solar hot water systems was approximately 436 thermal gigawatt (GWth ) and China is the world leader in their deployment with 309 GWth installed, taken up 71% of the market.The most common types of solar water heaters are evacuated tube collectors (44%) and glazed flat plate collectors (34%) generally used for domestic hot water; and unglazed plastic collectors (21%) used mainly to heat swimming pools.\n",
      "Israel and Cyprus are the per capita leaders in the use of solar hot water systems with over 90% of homes using them.\n",
      "In the United States, Canada and Australia, heating swimming pools is the dominant application of solar hot water with an installed capacity of 18 GWth as of 2005.\n",
      "In the United States, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for 30% (4.65 EJ/yr) of the energy used in commercial buildings and nearly 50% (10.1 EJ+/yr ) of residential buildings.=== Heating, cooling and ventilation === HVAC systems are a major source of energy for commercial and residential buildings\n",
      "Solar heating, cooling and ventilation technologies can be used to offset a portion of this energy.\n",
      "Use of solar for heating can roughly be divided into passive solar concepts and active solar concepts, depending on whether active elements such as sun tracking and solar concentrator optics are used.\n",
      "Thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy.\n",
      "Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement, and water.\n",
      "Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night.\n",
      "However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well.\n",
      "The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting, and shading conditions.\n",
      "A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is a passive solar ventilation system composed of a vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building.When duly incorporated, thermal mass maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment.\n",
      "As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated, causing an updraft that pulls air through the building.\n",
      "Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials in a way that mimics greenhouses.\n",
      "Deciduous trees and plants have been promoted as a means of controlling solar heating and cooling.\n",
      "When planted on the southern side of a building in the northern hemisphere or the northern side in the southern hemisphere, their leaves provide shade during the summer, while the bare limbs allow light to pass during the winter.\n"

      "George Washington (February 22, 1732 – December 14, 1799 ) was an American military officer, statesman and Founding Father who served as the first president of the United States from 1789 to 1797.\n",
      "Appointed by the Second Continental Congress as commander of the Continental Army in June 1775, Washington led Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War and then served as president of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which drafted and ratified the Constitution of the United States and established the American federal government.\n",
      "Washington has thus been called the \"Father of his Country\".\n",
      "Washington's first public office, from 1749 to 1750, was as surveyor of Culpeper County in the Colony of Virginia.\n",
      "He subsequently received military training and was assigned command of the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War.\n",
      "He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was named a delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which appointed him Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army.\n",
      "Washington led American forces to a decisive victory over the British in the Revolutionary War, leading the British to sign the Treaty of Paris, which acknowledged the sovereignty and independence of the United States.\n",
      "He resigned his commission in 1783 after the conclusion of the Revolutionary War.\n",
      "Washington played an indispensable role in adopting and ratifying the Constitution, which replaced the Articles of Confederation in 1789.\n",
      "He was then twice elected president by the Electoral College unanimously.\n",
      "As the first U.S. president, Washington implemented a strong and well-financed national government while remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry that emerged between cabinet members Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton.\n",
      "During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while sanctioning the Jay Treaty.\n",
      "He set enduring precedents for the office of president, including use of the title \"Mr. President\" and the two-term tradition.\n",
      "His 1796 farewell address became a preeminent statement on republicanism in which he wrote about the importance of national unity and the dangers regionalism, partisanship and foreign influence pose to it.\n",
      "Washington has been memorialized by monuments, a federal holiday, various media depictions, geographical locations including the national capital, the State of Washington, stamps, and currency.\n",
      "He is ranked among the greatest U.S. presidents.\n",
      "In 1976, Washington was posthumously promoted to the rank of General of the Armies, the highest rank in the U.S. Army.\n",
      "His legacy has become increasingly controversial over time, however, as a result of his ownership of slaves and his relationship with slavery.\n",
      "His historical reputation has also been complicated in modern discourse by his policy of assimilating Native Americans into Anglo-American culture and waging war against indigenous peoples during the Revolutionary War and the Northwest Indian War.\n",
      "George Washington was born on February 22, 1732, at Popes Creek in Westmoreland County, Virginia.== Early life (1732–1752) ==\n",
      "He was the first of six children of Augustine and Mary Ball Washington.\n",
      "His father was a justice of the peace and a prominent public figure who had four additional children from his first marriage to Jane Butler.\n",
      "The family moved to Little Hunting Creek in 1734 before eventually settling in Ferry Farm near Fredericksburg, Virginia.\n",
      "When Augustine died in 1743, Washington inherited Ferry Farm and ten slaves; his older half-brother Lawrence inherited Little Hunting Creek and renamed it Mount Vernon.Washington did not have the formal education his elder brothers received at Appleby Grammar School in England, but he did attend the Lower Church School in Hartfield.\n",
      "He learned mathematics, trigonometry and land surveying, and became a talented draftsman and mapmaker.\n",
      "By early adulthood, he was writing with \"considerable force\" and \"precision\".\n",
      "As a teenager, to practice his penmanship, Washington compiled over a hundred rules for social interaction styled Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour in Company and Conversation, copied from an English translation of a French book of manners.Washington often visited Mount Vernon and Belvoir, the plantation of William Fairfax, Lawrence's father-in-law.\n",
      "Fairfax became Washington's patron and surrogate father and Washington spent a month in 1748 with a team surveying Fairfax's Shenandoah Valley property.\n",
      "The following year, he received a surveyor's license from the College of William & Mary.\n",
      "Even though Washington had not served the customary apprenticeship, Fairfax appointed him surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia, where he took his oath of office July 20, 1749.\n",
      "He subsequently familiarized himself with the frontier region and though he resigned from the job in 1750, he continued to do surveys west of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n",
      "By 1752, he had bought almost 1,500 acres (600 ha) in the Valley and owned 2,315 acres (937 ha).In 1751, Washington made his only trip abroad when he accompanied Lawrence to Barbados, hoping the climate would cure his brother's tuberculosis.\n",
      "Washington contracted smallpox during that trip, which left his face slightly scarred.\n",
      "Lawrence died in 1752, and Washington leased Mount Vernon from his widow Anne; he inherited it outright after her death in 1761.\n",
      "Lawrence Washington's service as adjutant general of the Virginia militia inspired George to seek a commission.== Colonial military career (1752–1758) ==\n",
      "Virginia's lieutenant governor, Robert Dinwiddie, appointed Washington as a major and commander of one of the four militia districts.\n",
      "The British and French were competing for control of the Ohio Valley: the British were constructing forts along the Ohio River and the French between the Ohio and Lake Erie.In October 1753, Dinwiddie appointed Washington as a special envoy.\n",
      "He had sent Washington to demand French forces to vacate land that was claimed by the British.\n",
      "Washington was also appointed to make peace with the Iroquois Confederacy and to gather further intelligence about the French forces.\n",
      "Washington met with Half-King Tanacharison, and other Iroquois chiefs, at Logstown, and gathered information about the numbers and locations of the French forts, as well as intelligence concerning individuals taken prisoner by the French.\n",
      "Washington was nicknamed Conotocaurius by Tanacharison.\n",
      "The name, meaning \"devourer of villages\", had been given to his great-grandfather John Washington in the late 17th century by the Susquehannock.Washington's party reached the Ohio River in November 1753, and was intercepted by a French patrol.\n",
      "The party was escorted to Fort Le Boeuf, where Washington was received in a friendly manner.\n",
      "He delivered the British demand to vacate to the French commander Saint-Pierre, but the French refused to leave.\n",
      "Saint-Pierre gave Washington his official answer after a few days' delay, as well as food and winter clothing for his party's journey back to Virginia.\n",
      "Washington completed the precarious mission in 77 days, in difficult winter conditions, achieving a measure of distinction when his report was published in Virginia and London.\n",
      "In February 1754, Dinwiddie promoted Washington to lieutenant colonel and second-in-command of the 300-strong Virginia Regiment, with orders to confront French forces at the Forks of the Ohio.=== French and Indian War ===\n",
      "Washington set out with half the regiment in April and soon learned a French force of 1,000 had begun construction of Fort Duquesne there.\n",
      "In May, having set up a defensive position at Great Meadows, he learned that the French had made camp seven miles (11 km) away; he decided to take the offensive.The French detachment proved to be only about 50 men, so Washington advanced on May 28 with a small force of Virginians and Indian allies to ambush them.\n",
      "During the ambush, French forces were killed outright with muskets and hatchets, including French commander Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, who had been carrying a diplomatic message for the British.\n",
      "The full Virginia Regiment joined Washington at Fort Necessity the following month with news that he had been promoted to command of the regiment and colonel upon the regimental commander's death.The French later found their countrymen dead and scalped, blaming Washington, who had retreated to Fort Nucessity.\n",
      "The regiment was reinforced by an independent company of a hundred South Carolinians led by Captain James Mackay; his royal commission outranked Washington's and a conflict of command ensued.\n",
      "On July 3, a French force attacked with 900 men, and the ensuing battle ended in Washington's surrender.\n",
      "In the aftermath, Colonel James Innes took command of intercolonial forces, the Virginia Regiment was divided and Washington was offered a captaincy in one of the newly formed regiments.He signed a surrender document in which he unwittingly took responsibility for \"assassinating\" Jumonville, later blaming the translator for not properly translating it.\n",
      "He refused, however, as it would have been a demotion and instead resigned his commission.\n",
      "The \"Jumonville affair\" became the incident which ignited the French and Indian War, later to become part of the Seven Years' War.\n",
      "In 1755, Washington served voluntarily as an aide to General Edward Braddock, who led a British expedition to expel the French from Fort Duquesne and the Ohio Country.\n",
      "On Washington's recommendation, Braddock split the army into one main column and a lightly equipped \"flying column\".\n",
      "Suffering from severe dysentery, Washington was left behind at Monongahela the French and their Indian allies ambushed the divided army.\n",

      "The game has various formats, ranging from T-10(Ten-10) played in around 90 minutes to Test matches which can last up to five days.\n",
      "Cricket was created during Saxon or Norman times by children living in the Weald, an area of dense woodlands and clearings in south-east England that lies across Kent and Sussex.== Early cricket == === Origin ===\n",
      "The first definite written reference is from the end of the 16th century.\n",
      "There have been several speculations about the game's origins, including some that it was created in France or Flanders.\n",
      "The earliest of these speculative references is from 1300 and concerns the future King Edward II playing at \"creag and other games\" in both Westminster and Newenden.\n",
      "It has been suggested that \"creag\" was an Old English word for cricket, but expert opinion is that it was an early spelling of \"craic\", meaning \"fun and games in general\".It is generally believed that cricket survived as a children's game for many generations before it was increasingly taken up by adults around the beginning of the 17th century.\n",
      "Possibly cricket was derived from bowls, assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its target by hitting it away.\n",
      "Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a stool or a tree stump or a gate (e. g., a wicket gate ) as the wicket.\n",
      "In 1597 (Old Style – 1598 New Style) a court case in England concerning an ownership dispute over a plot of common land in Guildford, Surrey, mentions the game of creckett.=== First definite reference ===\n",
      "A 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, testified that he and his school friends had played creckett on the site fifty years earlier when they attended the Free School.\n",
      "The first reference to cricket being played as an adult sport was in 1611, when two men in Sussex were prosecuted for playing cricket on Sunday instead of going to church.Derrick's account proves beyond reasonable doubt that the game was being played in Surrey circa 1550 and is the earliest universally accepted reference to the game.\n",
      "In the same year, a dictionary defined cricket as a boys' game and this suggests that adult participation was a recent development.\n",
      "Cricket is a popular sport in the world of cricket.A number of words are thought to be possible sources for the term \"cricket\".\n",
      "In the earliest definite reference, it was spelled creckett.\n",
      "The name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch krick(-e), meaning a stick; or the Old English cricc or cryce meaning a crutch or staff, or the French word criquet meaning a wooden post.\n",
      "The Middle Dutch word krickstoel means a long low stool used for kneeling in church; this resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.\n",
      "According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of the University of Bonn, \"cricket\" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i. e., \"with the stick chase\").It is more likely that the terminology of cricket was based on words in use in south-east England at the time and, given trade connections with the County of Flanders, especially in the 15th century when it belonged to\n",

      "As the Sabbath was the only free time available to the lower classes, cricket's popularity may have waned during the Commonwealth.\n",
      "However, it did flourish in public fee-paying schools such as Winchester and St Paul's.\n",
      "There is no actual evidence that Oliver Cromwell's regime banned cricket specifically and there are references to it during the interregnum that suggest it was acceptable to the authorities provided that it did not cause any \"breach of the Sabbath\".\n",
      "It is believed that the nobility in general adopted cricket at this time through involvement in village games.\n",
      "Cricket thrived after the Restoration in 1660 and is believed to have first attracted gamblers making large bets at this time.=== Gambling and press coverage ===\n",
      "It is possible, as believed by some historians, that top-class matches began in the 18th century\n",
      "In 1664, the \"Cavalier\" Parliament passed the Gaming Act 1664 which limited stakes to £100, although that was still a fortune at the time, equivalent to about £16,000 in present-day terms.\n",
      "Cricket had become a significant gambling sport by the end of the 17th century as evidenced in 1697 by a newspaper report of a \"great match\" played in Sussex which was 11-a-side and played for high stakes of 50 guineas a side.With freedom of the press having been granted in 1696, cricket for the first time could be reported in the newspapers.\n",
      "But it was a long time before the newspaper industry adapted sufficiently to provide frequent, let alone comprehensive, coverage of the game.\n",
      "During the first half of the 18th century, press reports tended to focus on the betting rather than on the play.\n",
      "Gambling introduced the first patrons because some of the gamblers decided to strengthen their bets by forming their own teams and it is believed the first \"county teams\" were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration in 1660, especially as members of the nobility were employing \"local experts\" from village cricket as the earliest professionals.== 18th-century cricket == === Patronage and players ===\n",
      "The first known game in which the teams use county names is in 1709 but there can be little doubt that these sort of fixtures were being arranged long before that.\n",
      "The match in 1697 was probably Sussex versus another county.\n",
      "The most notable of the early patrons were a group of aristocrats and businessmen who were active from about 1725, which is the time that press coverage became more regular, perhaps as a result of the patrons' influence.\n",

      "New Zealand and South Africa followed in the early years of the 19th century.Cricket never caught on in Canada, despite efforts by the upper class to promote the game as a way of identifying with the \"mother country\".\n",
      "Canada, unlike Australia and the West Indies, witnessed a continual decline in the popularity of the game during 1860 to 1960.\n",

      "These laws stated that \"the principals shall choose from amongst the gentlemen present two umpires who shall absolutely decide all disputes\".\n",
      "The codes were drawn up by the so-called \"Star and Garter Club\" whose members ultimately founded the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's in 1787.\n",
      "The MCC immediately became the custodian of the Laws and has made periodic revisions and recodifications subsequently.\n",
      "The game continued to spread throughout England and, in 1751, Yorkshire is first mentioned as a venue.=== Continued growth in England ===\n",
      "The original form of bowling (i. e., rolling the ball along the ground as in bowls ) was superseded sometime after 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball and study variations in line, length and pace.\n",
      "The first famous clubs were London and Dartford in the early 18th century.Scorecards began to be kept on a regular basis from 1772; since then an increasingly clear picture has emerged of the sport's development.\n",
      "London played its matches on the Artillery Ground, which still exists.\n",

      "There are many terms used to describe association football, the sport most commonly referred to in the English-speaking world as \"football\" or \"soccer\".\n",
      "The rules of Association football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863.== Background ==\n",
      "The alternative name soccer was first coined in late 19th century England to help distinguish between several codes of football that were growing in popularity at that time, in particular rugby football.\n",
      "The word soccer is an abbreviation of association (from assoc.)\n",
      "and first appeared in English Public Schools and universities in the 1880s (sometimes using the variant spelling \"socker\") where it retains some popularity of use to this day.\n",
      "The word is sometimes credited to Charles Wreford-Brown, an Oxford University student said to have been fond of shortened forms such as brekkers for breakfast and rugger for rugby football (see Oxford -er).\n",
      "However, the attribution to Wreford-Brown in particular is generally considered to be spurious.\n",
      "Clive Toye noted \"they took the third, fourth and fifth letters of Association and called it SOCcer.\n",
      "\"The sport's full name Association football has never been widely used, although in Britain some clubs in rugby football strongholds adopted the suffix Association Football Club (A.F.C.).\n",
      "To avoid confusion with the dominant sport in their area, and FIFA, the world governing body for the sport, is a French-language acronym of \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" – the International Association Football Federation.\n",
      "\"Soccer football\" is used less often than it once was: the United States Soccer Federation was known as the US Soccer Football Association from 1945 until 1974, when it adopted its current name; and the Canadian Soccer Association was known from 1958 to 1971.\n",
      "For nearly a hundred years after it was first coined, soccer was used as an uncontroversial alternative in Britain to football, often in colloquial and juvenile contexts but was also widely used in formal speech and in writing about the game.=== Transition away from soccer in Britain ===\n",
      "\"Soccer\" was a term used by the upper class whereas the working and middle classes preferred the word \"football\"; as the upper classes lost influence in British society from the 1960s on, \"football\" supplanted \"soccer\" as the most commonly used and accepted word.\n",
      "The use of soccer is declining in Britain and is now considered (albeit incorrectly, due to the word's British origin) to be an exclusively American English term.\n",
      "Since the early twenty-first century, the peak association football authorities in soccer-labeling Australia and New Zealand have actively promoted the use of football to mirror international usage and to rebrand a sport that had been experiencing difficulties.\n",
      "Both bodies dropped soccer from their names.\n",
      "These efforts have met with considerable success in New Zealand, but have not taken effect well in Australia or Papua New Guinea.\n",
      "The name of association football varies among the countries or territories who hold the English language as an official or de facto official language.== English-speaking countries ==\n",
      "The brief survey of usage below addresses places which have some level of autonomy in the sport and their own separate federation but are not actually independent countries: for example the constituent countries of the United Kingdom and some overseas territories each have their own federation and national team.\n",
      "Not included are places such as Cyprus, where English is widely spoken on the ground but is not amongst the country's specifically stated official languages.\n",
      "Association football is known as \"football\" in the majority of countries where English is an official language, such as the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth Caribbean (including Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, Belize, Barbados and others), Nepal, Malta, India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Cameroon, Pakistan, Liberia, Singapore, Hong Kong and others, stretching over many regions including parts of Europe, Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and Central America.=== Countries where it is called football ===\n",
      "In North America and Australia (where approximately 70 per cent of native English speakers reside), soccer is the primary term.\n",
      "Fitbaa, fitba or fitbaw is a rendering of the Scots pronunciation of \"football\", often used in a humorous or ironic context.\n",
      "In the United States, where American football is more popular, the word football is used to refer only to that sport.=== North America ===\n",
      "Association football is most commonly referred to as soccer.\n",
      "As early as 1911 there were several names in use for the sport in the Americas.\n",
      "The sport's governing body is the United States Soccer Federation; however, it was originally called the U.S. Football Association, and was formed in 1913 by the merger of the American Football Association and the American Amateur Football Association.A 29 December 1911 New York Times article reporting on the addition of the game as an official collegiate sport in the US referred to it as \"association football\", \"soccer\" and \"football\" all in a single article.\n",
      "The word \"soccer\" was added to the name in 1945, making it the U.S. Soccer Football Association, and it did not drop the word \"football\" until 1974, when it assumed its current name.\n",
      "In Canada, similar to the US, the term \"football\" refers to gridiron football (either Canadian football or American football; le football canadien or le football américain in Standard French).\n",
      "\"Soccer\" is the name for association football in Canadian English (similarly, in Canadian French, le soccer).\n",
      "Likewise, in majority francophone Quebec, the provincial governing body is the Fédération de Soccer du Québec.\n",
      "This is unusual compared to francophone countries, where football is generally used.\n",
      "Canada's national body government of the sport is named the Canada Soccer Association, although at first its original name was the Dominion of Canada Football Association.\n",
      "Some teams based in the two countries have adopted FC as a suffix or prefix in their names; in Major League Soccer, these include Austin FC, Minnesota United FC, Chicago Fire FC, Atlanta United FC, FC Dallas, Seattle Sounders FC, Toronto FC, Vancouver Whitecaps FC, New York City FC, Los Angeles FC, FC Cincinnati and\n",
      "All teams in the Canadian Premier League use FC as a suffix while FC Edmonton is the only team in the league that uses it as a prefix while FC Ottawa uses FC as an abbreviation for the team's name.\n",
      "In Central America, the only English-speaking nation is Belize, and like the other six Central American nations, the unqualified term football refers to association football, as used in the Football Federation of Belize and in the Belize Premier Football League.\n",
      "In the Caribbean, most of the English-speaking members use the word football for their federations and leagues, the exception being the U.S. Virgin Islands, where both federation and league use the term soccer.However, the word soccer is sometimes used in vernacular speech and media coverage.\n",
      "An exceptional case is the largely Spanish-speaking Puerto Rico, where the word football is used in the Puerto Rican Football Federation, while the word soccer is used by the Puerto Rico Soccer League, the 1st division; however, its 2nd division is named Liga Nacional de Futbol de Puerto Rico.\n",
      "Soccer is the most common term in vernacular speech, however.\n",
      "Another case is the Dutch island of Sint Maarten, where soccer is used in the Dutch Soccer Association, but neither football nor soccer appears in its league name: instead, the Dutch voetbal is used.\n",
      "Traditionally, the sport has been mainly referred to as soccer in Australia.=== Australia ===\n",
      "This is primarily due to Australian rules football and rugby league taking precedence of the name in conversation due to their greater cultural prominence and popularity - similarly to North America and gridiron football.\n",
      "However, in 2005, the Australia Soccer Association changed its name to Football Federation Australia, and it now encourages the use of \"football\" to describe the association code in line with international practice.\n",
      "All state organisations, many clubs, and most media outlets have followed its example.\n",
      "The Macquarie Dictionary observed, writing prior to 2010: \"While it is still the case that soccer is the preferred term in Australia for what most of the world calls football, the fact that the peak body in Australia has officially adopted the term football for this sport will undoubtedly cause a shift in usage.\"\n",
      "This was highlighted shortly afterwards when then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard, speaking in Melbourne, referred to the sport as football, emphasising her choice when questioned.\n",
      "The Australian men's team is still known by its long-standing nickname, the Socceroos, the Soccer Ashes is still referred to as such and \"soccer\" is still the most popular term for the sport in Australia.\n",
      "Historically, the derogatory term \"wogball\" has been used to refer to the sport.\n",
      "This is due to \"wog\" being a derogatory (but since appropriated in some contexts) term referring to Australians of Mediterranean background (particularly Croatians, Egyptians, Greeks, Italians, Lebanese, Macedonians, Maltese and Turks ) among whom the sport was most popular.\n",
      "It was also derogatorily described as a game for \"sheilas, wogs and poofters\" (with women and \"poofters\" being homosexuals).\n",
      "Former Australian soccer player Johnny Warren later released a book titled Sheilas, Wogs and Poofters.\n"

      "###########################################################################\n",
      "Gameplay in American football consists of a series of downs, individual plays of short duration, outside of which the ball is dead or not in play.\n",
      "These can be plays from scrimmage – passes, runs, punts or field goal attempts (from either a place kick or a drop kick) – or free kicks such as kickoffs and fair catch kicks.\n",
      "Substitutions can be made between downs, which allows for a great deal of specialization as coaches choose the players best suited for each particular situation.\n",
      "During a play, each team should have no more than 11 players on the field and each of them has specific tasks assigned for that specific play.\n",
      "The objective of this game is to score more points than the other team during the allotted time.== Objective of the game ==\n",
      "The team with the ball (the offense) has 4 plays (downs) to advance at least 10 yards and can score points once they reach the opposite end of the field, which is home to a scoring zone called the end zone, as well as the goalposts.\n",
      "If the offense succeeds in advancing at least 10 yards, they earn a \"first down\" and the number of tries allotted is reset and then they are again given 4 tries to advance an additional 10 yards starting from the spot to which they last advanced.\n",
      "If the offense does not advance at least 10 yards during their 4 downs, the team without the ball (the defense) regains control of the ball and regains possession of it (called turnover on downs).\n",
      "On offense, points are scored by advancing the ball into the opponent's end zone for a touchdown (worth six points ) or by kicking the ball from the playing field through the raised vertical posts (the goalposts ) which are most commonly situated on the end line of the end zone (worth three points).\n",
      "After scoring a touchdown, the offense is given an additional opportunity from the 2-yard line (3/yard line in amateur football) to attempt to score (in the NFL, 15-yard-line on 1-point conversions).\n",
      "The offense may attempt a field goal kick which is worth 1 point.Conversion attempts are used to score 1 or 2 points as follows:\n",
      "While the opposing team has possession, the defense attempts to prevent the offense from advancing the ball and scoring.The offense may attempt to re-advance the ball into the opponent's end zone for a two-point conversion worth 2 points.\n",
      "If an offensive player loses the ball during play (a fumble) or the ball is caught by a defensive player while still in the air (an interception), the defense may attempt to run into the offense's end zone for a touchdown.\n",
      "The defense may also score points by tackling the ball carrier in the offense's own end zone, called a safety (which is worth two points).\n",
      "Collegiate and professional football games are 1 hour long, divided into four quarters of 15 minutes each.== Time of play ==\n",
      "In high school football, 12 minute quarters are usually played.\n",
      "The clock is stopped frequently, however, with the result that a typical college or professional game can exceed three hours in duration.\n",
      "The referee controls the game clock and stops the clock after any incomplete pass or any play that ends out of bounds.\n",
      "In addition, each team is allowed 3 timeouts in each half that they may use at their own discretion.\n",
      "The clock normally runs during the action of plays, with a few exceptions known as untimed plays.\n",
      "Some high schools employ a mercy rule in which the clock runs continuously after one team's lead over the other achieves a certain number of points.\n",
      "In these instances, the clock only stops for injuries, or time outs called by a team or a referee.\n",
      "The clock may also be stopped for an officials' time-out, after which, if the clock was running, it is restarted.\n",
      "For example: if there is a question whether or not a team has moved the ball far enough for a first down, the officials may use a measuring device (the chains) to determine the distance.\n",
      "While this measurement is taking place, the officials will signal for a stoppage of the clock.\n",
      "Once the measurement is finished and the ball is placed at the proper location (spotted), the referee will then signal for the clock to restart.\n",
      "Additional situations where officials may take a time-out are to administer a penalty or for an injured player to be removed from the field.\n",
      "In addition to the game clock, a separate play clock is also used.\n",
      "This counts down the time the offense has to start the next play before it is assessed a penalty for delay of game (see below).\n",
      "This clock is typically 25 seconds from when the referee marks the ball ready for play.\n",
      "The NFL and NCAA use a 40-second play clock that starts immediately after the previous play ends, though, for certain delays, such as penalty enforcement, the offense has 25 seconds from when the ball is marked ready.\n",
      "The purpose of the play clock is to ensure that the game progresses at a consistent pace, preventing unnecessary delays.\n",
      "Overall, clock management is a significant part of the game; teams leading toward the end of a game will often try to run out the clock via kneeldown while trailing teams attempt the opposite.\n",
      "Officials also call for media time-outs, which allow time for television and radio advertising.\n",
      "They also stop the clock after a change of possession of the ball from one team to the other.\n",
      "Successful PATs (Point(s) After Touchdown), a field goal try or a kickoff may also warrant stopping the clock.\n",
      "If an instant replay challenge is called during the game, the referees signal for a media time out.\n",
      "The referee signals these media time-outs by first using the time out signal, then extending both arms in a horizontal position.\n",
      "Teams change ends of the field at the end of the first quarter and the third quarter, though otherwise, the situation on the field regarding possession, downs remaining and distance-to-goal does not change at these occasions (so a team with possession 5 yards from the opponent's endzone at end of first quarter would resume playing 5 yards away from the endzone, which they would then be attacking).\n",
      "Separating the first and second halves is halftime.\n",
      "Both halves, and any overtime, begin with kick-offs — the kicking team is decided by a coin toss (see below).\n",
      "In the NFL, an automatic timeout is called by the officials once the ball is dead and there are two minutes or less left in both the second and the fourth quarters and overtime; this is most commonly referred to as the two-minute warning.\n",
      "No such warning is normally given in amateur football, though if there is no visible stadium clock, the referee will give a two-minute warning (four minutes in high school).\n",
      "In the preseason, prior to 1973 and since 2021, games that are tied at the end of four quarters end in a tie.== Overtime == === NFL ===\n",
      "In the regular season and playoffs, if a game is tied at the end of four quarters, overtime is played.\n",
      "In overtime, a coin toss is used to determine which team will possess the ball first.\n",
      "The winner of the coin toss can choose to give the ball or receive the ball.\n",
      "In a regular season, if the first possession results in a touchdown (by the receiving team or by the defensive team on a turnover) or a safety, the scoring team wins.\n",
      "If the receiving team fails to score and loses possession, the game goes into sudden death and the first to score wins.\n",
      "However, if the initial receiving team only scores a field goal, the game is not automatically over and the other team is given an opportunity to possess the ball as well.\n",
      "The other team can win with a touchdown, tie with a field goal leading to sudden death or lose if they fail to score.\n",
      "In a playoff, both teams will have the opportunity to possess the ball.\n",
      "If the score is tied after each team has possessed the ball, the next score wins.\n",
      "During the regular season in the NFL, one overtime period is played (with each team receiving two-time outs).If the team kicking off to start the overtime scores a safety on the receiving team's initial possession, the team that kicked off is the winner.\n",
      "If the game is still tied after the 10-minute overtime period, the game officially ends in a tie.\n",
      "In the playoffs, overtime periods continue until a winner is determined.\n",
      "Overtime follows a three-minute intermission after the end of the regulation game.\n",
      "Prior to the start of overtime, a coin flip is performed in which the captain of the visiting team calls the toss.\n",
      "The team that wins the coin flip has the option either to receive the kickoff or choose the side of the field they wish to defend.\n",
      "Ties are rare in the NFL; the most recent being a game between the Washington Commanders and New York Giants on December 4, 2022, which ended in a 20–all tie.\n",
      "See List of NFL tied games for more games.\n",
      "From the 2017 season, the overtime period was shortened from 15 minutes to 10 minutes for the preseason and regular season.==== Rule changes ====\n",
      "Prior to the 2010–11 playoffs, the overtime winner was simply the first team to score any points; however, the rules were changed to reduce the advantage obtained by the team that won the overtime coin toss.The overtime for the postseason remains 15 minutes.\n",
      "Under the prior rules, the team that won the coin toss would usually elect to receive the ball, then gain just enough yardage to win the game by kicking a field goal without the other team ever touching the ball.\n",
      "The coin toss winner won approximately 60% of overtime games under that rule rather than the 50% which would be expected by random chance.The first overtime game played under a trial of the new overtime rules occurred in a 2012 AFC wild card game between the Denver Broncos and Pittsburgh Steelers at Sports Authority Field at Mile High, Denver, Colorado.\n",
      "Denver won the game on the first play in overtime, an 80-yard touchdown pass from Tim Tebow to Demaryius Thomas.\n"

      "The first book in history of securities exchange was written by the Dutch-Jewish trader Joseph de la Vega and the Amsterdam Stock Exchange is often considered the oldest \"modern\" securities market in the world.\n",
      "On the other hand, economist Ulrike Malmendier of the University of California at Berkeley argues that a share market existed as far back as ancient Rome, that derives from Etruscan \"Argentari\".\n",
      "In the Roman Republic, which existed for centuries before the Empire was founded, there were societates publicanorum, organizations of contractors or leaseholders who performed temple-building and other services for the government.\n",
      "One such service was the feeding of geese on the Capitoline Hill as a reward to the birds after their honking warned of a Gallic invasion in 390 B.C.\n",
      "Participants in such organizations had partes or shares, a concept mentioned various times by the statesman and orator Cicero.\n",
      "In one speech, Cicero mentions \"shares that had a very high price at the time\".\n",
      "Such evidence, in Malmendier's view, suggests the instruments were tradable, with fluctuating values based on an organization's success.\n",
      "The societas declined into obscurity in the time of the emperors as most of their services were taken over by direct agents of the state.\n",

      "Jaguar Cars was the company that was responsible for the production of Jaguar cars until its operations were fully merged with those of Land Rover to form Jaguar Land Rover on 1 January 2013.\n",
      "Jaguar's business was founded as the Swallow Sidecar Company in 1922, originally making motorcycle sidecars before developing bodies for passenger cars.\n",
      "Under the ownership of SS Cars, the business extended to complete cars made in association with Standard Motor Company, many bearing Jaguar as a model name.\n",
      "The company's name was changed from SS Cars to Jaguar Cars in 1945.\n",
      "A merger with the British Motor Corporation followed in 1966, the resulting enlarged company now being renamed as British Motor Holdings (BMH), which in 1968 merged with Leyland Motor Corporation and became British Leyland, itself to be nationalised in 1975.\n",
      "Jaguar was spun off from British Leyland and was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1984 until it was acquired by Ford in 1990.\n",
      "Since the late 1970s, Jaguar manufactured cars for the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, the most recent prime ministerial car delivery being an XJ (X351) in May 2010.\n",
      "Ford owned Jaguar Cars, also buying Land Rover in 2000, until 2008 when it sold both to Tata Motors.The company also held royal warrants from Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Charles.\n",
      "Tata created Jaguar Land Rover as a subsidiary holding company.\n",
      "At operating company level, Jaguar Cars was merged in 2013 with Land Rover to form Jaguar Land Rover as the single design, manufacture, sales company and brand owner for both Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles.\n",
      "Since the Ford ownership era, Jaguar and Land Rover have used joint design facilities in engineering centres at Whitley in Coventry and Gaydon in Warwickshire and Jaguar cars have been assembled in plants at Castle Bromwich and Solihull.\n",
      "On 15 February 2021, Jaguar Land Rover announced that all cars made under the Jaguar brand will be fully electric by 2025.\n",
      "The Swallow Sidecar Company was founded in 1922 by two motorcycle enthusiasts, William Lyons and William Walmsley.== History ===== Founding ===\n",
      "In 1934, Walmsley elected to sell-out and in order to buy the Swallow business (but not the company which was liquidated) Lyons formed SS Cars, finding new capital by issuing shares to the public.\n",
      "Jaguar first appeared in September 1935 as a model name on an SS 2½-litre sports saloon.\n",
      "A matching open two seater sports model with a 3½-litre engine was named SS Jaguar 100.\n",
      "On 23 March 1945, the S. S. Cars shareholders in general meeting agreed to change the company's name to Jaguar Cars Limited.\n",
      "Said chairman William Lyons \"Unlike S. S. the name Jaguar is distinctive and cannot be connected or confused with any similar foreign name.\n",
      "\"Though five years of pent-up demand ensured plenty of buyers production was hampered by shortage of materials, particularly steel, issued to manufacturers until the 1950s by a central planning authority under strict government control.\n",
      "Jaguar sold Motor Panels, a pressed steel body manufacturing company bought in the late 1930s to steel and components manufacturer Rubery Owen, and Jaguar bought from John Black's Standard Motor Company the plant where Standard built Jaguar's six-cylinder engines.\n",
      "From this time Jaguar was entirely dependent for their bodies on external suppliers, in particular then independent Pressed Steel and in 1966 that carried them into BMC, BMH and British Leyland.\n",
      "Jaguar made its name by producing a series of successful eye-catching sports cars, the Jaguar XK120 (1948–54), XK140 (1954–57), Jaguar EK150 (1957–61), and Jaguar E-Type (1961–75), all embodying Lyons' mantra of \"value for money\".\n",
      "The sports cars were successful in international motorsport, a path followed in the 1950s to prove the engineering integrity of the company's products.\n",
      "Jaguar's sales slogan for years was \"Grace, Space, Pace\", a mantra epitomised by the record sales achieved by the MK VII, IX, Mks I and II saloons and later the XJ6.\n",
      "The core of Bill Lyons' success following the Second World War was the twin-cam straight six engine, conceived pre-war and realised while engineers at the Coventry plant were dividing their time between fire-watching and designing the new power plant.During the time this slogan was used, but the exact text varied.\n",
      "It had a hemispherical cross-flow cylinder head with valves inclined from the vertical; originally at 30 degrees (inlet) and 45 degrees (exhaust) and later standardised to 45 degrees for both inlet and exhaust.\n",
      "As fuel octane ratings were relatively low from 1948 onwards, three piston configuration were offered: domed (high octane), flat (medium octane) and dished (low octane).\n",
      "The main designer, William Heynes, assisted by Walter Hassan, was determined to develop the Twin OHC unit.\n",
      "Bill Lyons agreed over misgivings from Hassan.\n",
      "It was risky to take what had previously been considered a racing or low-volume and cantankerous engine needing constant fettling and apply it to reasonable volume production saloon cars.\n",
      "The subsequent engine (in various versions) was the mainstay powerplant of Jaguar, used in the XK 120, Mk VII Saloon, Mk I and II Saloons and XK 140 and 150.\n",
      "It was also employed in the E Type, itself a development from the race winning and Le Mans conquering C and D Type Sports Racing cars refined as the short-lived XKSS, a road-legal D-Type.\n",
      "Jaguar used the Twin OHC XK Engine in the Jaguar XJ6 saloon from 1969 through 1992, and employed in a J60 variant as the power plant in such diverse vehicles as the British Army's Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) family of vehicles, as well as the Fox armoured reconnaissance vehicle, the Ferret Scout Car and the Stonefield four-wheel-drive all-terrain lorry.Few engine types have demonstrated such ubiquity and longevity:\n",
      "Properly maintained, the standard production XK Engine would achieve 200,000 miles of useful life.\n",
      "Two of the proudest moments in Jaguar's long history in motor sport involved winning the Le Mans 24 hours race, firstly in 1951 and again in 1953.\n",
      "Victory at the 1955 Le Mans was overshadowed by it being the occasion of the worst motorsport accident in history.\n",
      "Later in the hands of the Scottish racing team Ecurie Ecosse two more wins were added in 1956 and 1957.\n",
      "In spite of such a performance orientation, it was always Lyons' intention to build the business by producing world-class sporting saloons in larger numbers than the sports car market could support.\n",
      "Jaguar secured financial stability and a reputation for excellence with a series of elegantly styled luxury saloons that included the 3-litre and 3½ litre cars, the Mark VII, VIII and IX, the compact Mark I and 2, and the XJ6 and XJ12.\n",
      "All were deemed very good values, with comfortable rides, good handling, high performance, and great style.\n",
      "Combined with the trend-setting XK 120, XK 140 series of sports car, and nonpareil E-Type, Jaguar's elan as a prestige motorcar manufacturer had few rivals.\n",
      "The company's post-War achievements are remarkable, considering both the shortages that drove Britain (the Ministry of Supply still allocated raw materials) and the state of metallurgical development of the era.\n",
      "In 1950, Jaguar agreed to lease from the Ministry of Supply the Daimler Shadow 2 factory in Browns Lane, Allesley, Coventry, which at the time was being used by Daimlers and moved to the new site from Foleshill over the next 12 months.In 1950, Jaguar moved to Browns Lane, Allesley, Coventry.\n",
      "Jaguar purchased Daimler, not to be confused with Mercedes-Benz or Daimlers AG, in 1960 from BSA.\n",
      "Jaguar used the Daimler marque as a brand name for their most luxurious saloons.From the late 1960s\n",
      "Pressed Steel Company Limited made all Jaguar's (monocoque) bodies leaving provision and installation of the mechanicals to Jaguar.=== Ownership === An end to independence ====\n",
      "In mid-1965 British Motor Corporation (BMC), the Austin-Morris combine, bought Pressed Steel.\n",
      "Lyons became concerned about the future of Jaguar, partly because of the threat to ongoing supplies of bodies, and partly because he age and lack of an heir.\n",
      "He therefore accepted BMC's offer to merge with Jaguar to form British Motor (Holdings) Limited.\n",
      "At a press conference on 11 July 1965 at the Great Eastern Hotel in London, Lyons and BMC chairman George Harriman announced that Jaguar Group of companies is to merge with The British Motor Corporation Ltd., as the first step towards the setting up of a joint holding company to be called British Motor (Holdings) Limited.\n",
      "In due course BMC changed its name to British Motor Holdings at the end of 1966.\n",
      "BMH was pushed by the Government to merge with Leyland Motor Corporation Limited, manufacturer of Leyland bus and truck, Standard-Triumph and, since 1967, Rover vehicles.\n",
      "The result was British Leyland Motor Corporation, a new holding company which appeared in 1968, but the combination was not a success.\n",
      "A combination of poor decision making by the board along with the financial difficulties of the Austin-Morris division (previously BMC) led to the Ryder Report and to effective nationalisation in 1975.\n",
      "Over the next few years it became clear that because of the low regard for many of the group's products insufficient capital could be provided to develop and begin manufacture of new models, including Jaguars, particularly if Jaguar were to remain a part of the Group.==== Temporary return to independence ====\n",
      "In July 1984 Jaguar was floated off as a separate company on the London Stock Exchange;– one of the Thatcher government's many privatisations– to create its own track record.Installed as chairman in 1980, Sir John Egan is credited for Jaguar's unprecedented prosperity immediately after privatisation.\n"

      "By dropping weights from different heights into a block of clay, Willem's Gravesande determined that their penetration depth was proportional to the square of their impact speed.\n",
      "The terms kinetic energy and work in their present scientific meanings date back to the mid-19th century.Émilie du Châtelet recognized the implications of the experiment and published an explanation.\n",
      "Early understandings of these ideas can be attributed to Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis, who in 1829 published the paper titled Du Calcul de l'Effet des Machines outlining the mathematics of kinetic energy.\n",
      "William Thomson, later Lord Kelvin, is given the credit for coining the term \"kinetic energy\" c. 1849–1851.\n",

      "Kinetic energy is the movement energy of an object.\n",
      "Kinetic energy can be transferred between objects and transformed into other kinds of energy.It may be best understood by examples that demonstrate how it is transformed to and from other forms of energy.\n",
      "For example, a cyclist uses chemical energy provided by food to accelerate a bicycle to a chosen speed.\n",
      "On a level surface, this speed can be maintained without further work, except to overcome air resistance and friction.\n",
      "The chemical energy has been converted into kinetic energy, the energy of motion, but the process is not completely efficient and produces heat within the cyclist.\n",
      "The kinetic energy in the moving cyclist and the bicycle can be converted to other forms.\n",
      "For example, the cyclist could encounter a hill just high enough to coast up, so that the bicycle comes to a complete halt at the top.\n",
      "The kinetic energy has now largely been converted to gravitational potential energy that can be released by freewheeling down the other side of the hill.\n",
      "Since the bicycle lost some of its energy to friction, it never regains all of its speed without additional pedaling.\n",
      "The energy is not destroyed; it has only been converted to another form by friction.\n",
      "Alternatively, the cyclist could connect a dynamo to one of the wheels and generate some electrical energy on the descent.\n",
      "The bicycle would be traveling slower at the bottom of the hill than without the generator because some of the energy has been diverted into electrical energy.\n",
      "Another possibility would be for the cyclist to apply the brakes, in which case the kinetic energy would be dissipated through friction as heat.\n",
      "Like any physical quantity that is a function of velocity, the kinetic energy of an object depends on the relationship between the object and the observer's frame of reference.\n",
      "The kinetic energy of an object is not invariant.\n",
      "Spacecraft use chemical energy to launch and gain considerable kinetic energy to reach orbital velocity.\n",
      "In an entirely circular orbit, this kinetic energy remains constant because there is almost no friction in near-earth space.\n",
      "However, it becomes apparent at re-entry when some of the kinetic energy is converted to heat.\n",
      "If the orbit is elliptical or hyperbolic, then throughout the orbit kinetic and potential energy are exchanged; kinetic energy is greatest at closest approach to the earth or other massive body while potential energy is lowest at maximum distance.If elliptical orbits are elliptical, then kinetic energy decreases as the orbit approaches the earth, while the potential energy increases as it approaches the sun.\n",
      "Disregarding loss or gain however, the sum of the kinetic and potential energy remains constant.\n",
      "Kinetic energy can be passed from one object to another.\n",
      "In the game of billiards, the player imposes kinetic energy on the cue ball by striking it with the cue stick.\n",
      "If the cue ball collides with another ball, it slows down dramatically and the ball it hit accelerates as the kinetic energy is passed on to it.\n",
      "Collisions in billiards are effectively elastic collisions, in which kinetic energy is preserved.\n",
      "Inelastic collisions, kinetic energy is dissipated in various forms of energy, such as heat, sound and binding energy (breaking bound structures).\n",

      "Several mathematical descriptions of kinetic energy exist that describe it in the appropriate physical situation.\n",
      "For objects and processes in common human experience, the formula ½mv² given by classical mechanics is suitable.\n",

      "Due to this, asymmetric-key encryption is often used to exchange the secret key for symmetric key encryption.\n",
      "Symmetric-key encryption can use either stream ciphers or block cipherments to encrypt the digits (typically bytes or letters ) of a message one at a time.Stream cipher encrypts the digits or letters (in substitution ciphes) of the message one-at-a-time while block cipherciphers encrypt the messages one-by-one one-to-one.== Types ==\n",

      "It is also possible to increase the key length or the rounds in the encryption process to better protect against attack.\n",
      "Most modern symmetric-key algorithms appear to be resistant to the threat of post-quantum cryptography.This is due to the fact that the process is computationally intensive and requires a large amount of processing power and the amount of operations the system needs to do.This, however, tends to increase the processing power of the process and decrease the speed at which the process runs due to an increase in the number of computations the system has to do.\n",
      "Quantum computers would exponentially increase the speed at which these ciphers can be decoded; notably, Grover's algorithm would take the square-root of the time traditionally required for a brute-force attack, although these vulnerabilities can be compensated for by doubling key length.\n",
      "For example, a 128 bit AES cipher would not be secure against such an attack as it would reduce the time required to test all possible iterations from over 10 quintillion years to about six months.\n",
      "By contrast, it would still take a quantum computer the same amount of time to decode a 256 bit AES cipher as it would a conventional computer to encode a 128 bit cipher.\n",
      "For this reason, AES-256 is believed to be \"quantum resistant\".\n",
      "Symmetric-key algorithms require both the sender and the recipient of a message to have the same secret key.== Key management == == Key establishment ==\n",
      "All early cryptographic systems required either the sender or the recipient to somehow receive a copy of that secret key over a physically secure channel.\n",

      "Social media can be a useful source of market information and a way to hear customer perspectives.== Strategies ==There are two basic strategies for using social media as a marketing tool:\n",
      "Blogs, content communities, and forums are platforms where individuals share their reviews and recommendations of brands, products, and services.\n",
      "Social media is a relatively inexpensive source of market intelligence which can be used by marketers and managers to track and respond to consumer-identified problems and detect market opportunities.Businesses are able to tap and analyze the customer voices and feedback generated in social media for marketing purposes; in this sense the social media is\n",
      "For example, the Internet erupted with videos and pictures of iPhone 6 \"bend test\" which showed that the coveted phone could be bent by hand pressure.\n",
      "The so-called \"bend gate\" controversy created confusion amongst customers who had waited months for the launch of the latest rendition of the iPhone.\n",
      "However, Apple promptly issued a statement saying that the problem was extremely rare and that the company had taken several steps to make the mobile device's case stronger and robust.\n",
      "Unlike traditional market research methods such as surveys, focus groups and data mining which are time-consuming and costly, and which take weeks or even months to analyze, marketers can use social media to obtain 'live' or \"real time\" information about consumer behavior and viewpoints on a company's brand or products.\n",
      "This can be useful in the highly dynamic, competitive, fast-paced and global marketplace of the 2010s.\n",
      "Social media can be used not only as public relations and direct marketing tools, but also as communication channels targeting very specific audiences with social media influencers and social media personalities as effective customer engagement tools.=== Active approach ===\n",
      "This tactic is widely known as influencer marketing.\n",
      "Influencer marketing allows brands the opportunity to reach their target audience in a more genuine, authentic way via a special group of selected influencers advertising their product or service.\n",
      "In fact, brands are set to spend up to $15 billion on influencer marketing by 2022, per Business Insider Intelligence estimates, based on Mediakix data.Technologies predating social media, such as broadcast TV and newspapers can also provide advertisers with a fairly targeted audience, given that an ad placed during a sports game broadcast or in the sports section of a newspaper is likely to be read by sports fans.\n",
      "However, social media websites can target niche markets even more precisely.\n",
      "Using digital tools such as Google AdSense, advertisers can target their ads to very specific demographics, such as people who are interested in social entrepreneurship, political activism associated with a particular political party, or video gaming.\n",
      "Google AdSense does this by looking for keywords in social media user's online posts and comments.\n",
      "It would be hard for a TV station or paper-based newspaper to provide ads that are this targeted (though not impossible, as can be seen with \"special issue\" sections on niche issues, which newspapers can use to sell targeted ads).\n",
      "Social networks are, in many cases, viewed as a great tool for avoiding costly market research.\n",
      "They are known for providing a short, fast, and direct way to reach an audience through a person who is widely known.\n",
      "For example an athlete who gets endorsed by a sporting goods company also brings their support base of millions of people who are interested in what they do or how they play and now they want to be a part of this athlete through their endorsements with that particular company.\n",
      "At one point consumers would visit stores to view their products with famous athletes, but now you can view a famous athlete's latest apparel online with the click of a button.\n",
      "He advertises them to you directly through his Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts.\n",
      "Facebook and LinkedIn are leading social media platforms where users can hyper-target their ads.\n"

      "Thermal energy storage (TES ) is achieved with widely different technologies.\n",
      "Depending on the specific technology, it allows excess thermal energy to be stored and used hours, days, months later, at scales ranging from the individual process, building, multiuser-building, district, town or region.\n",
      "Usage examples are the balancing of energy demand between daytime and nighttime, storing summer heat for winter heating, or winter cold for summer air conditioning (Seasonal thermal energy storage).\n",
      "Storage media include water or ice-slush tanks, masses of native earth or bedrock accessed with heat exchangers by means of boreholes, deep aquifers contained between impermeable strata; shallow, lined pits filled with gravel and water and insulated at the top; eutectic solutions and phase-change materials.Other sources of thermal energy for storage include heat or cold produced with heat pumps from off-peak, lower cost electric power; heat from combined heat and power\n",
      "Heat storage, both seasonal and short term, is considered an important means for cheaply balancing high shares of variable renewable electricity production and integration of electricity and heating sectors in energy systems almost or completely fed by renewable energy.\n",
      "The different kinds of thermal energy storage can be divided into three separate categories: sensible heat, latent heat, and thermo-chemical heat storage.== Categories ==\n",
      "Each of these has different advantages and disadvantages that determine their applications.\n",
      "Sensible heat storage (SHS ) is the most straightforward method.=== Sensible heat storage ===\n",
      "It simply means the temperature of some medium is either increased or decreased.\n",
      "This type of storage is the most commercially available out of the three; other techniques are less developed.\n",
      "The materials are generally inexpensive and safe.\n",
      "One of the cheapest, most commonly used options is a water tank, but materials such as molten salts or metals can be heated to higher temperatures and therefore offer a higher storage capacity.\n",
      "Energy can also be stored underground (UTES ) either in an underground tank or in some kind of heat-transfer fluid (HTF) flowing through a system of pipes, either placed vertically in U-shapes (boreholes) or horizontally in trenches.\n",
      "Yet another system is known as a packed-bed (or pebble-bed) storage unit, in which some fluid flows through a bed of loosely packed material (usually rock, pebbles or ceramic brick ) to add or extract heat.\n",
      "A disadvantage of SHS is its dependence on the properties of the storage medium.\n",
      "Storage capacities are limited by the specific heat capacity of the storage material and the system needs to be properly designed to ensure energy extraction at a constant temperature.\n",
      "Molten salt technology is also used for storing solar energy at a high temperature termed molten-salt technology or molten salt energy storage (MSES).\n",
      "Molten salts can be employed as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy.\n",
      "Presently, this is a commercially used technology to store the heat collected by concentrated solar power (e. g., from a solar tower or solar trough).\n",
      "The heat can later be converted into superheated steam to power conventional steam turbines and generate electricity at a later time.\n",
      "It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999.\n",
      "Estimates in 2006 predicted an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference to the energy retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity versus converting heat directly into electricity.\n",
      "Various eutectic mixtures of different salts are used (e. g., sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate).\n",
      "Experience with such systems exists in non-solar applications in the chemical and metals industries as a heat-transport fluid.\n",
      "The salt melts at 131 °C (268 °F).\n",
      "It is kept liquid at 288 °C (550 °F) in an insulated \"cold\" storage tank.\n",
      "The liquid salt is pumped through panels in a solar collector where the focused sun heats it to 566 °C (1,051 °F).\n",
      "It is then sent to a hot storage tank.\n",
      "With proper insulation of the tank the thermal energy can be usefully stored for up to a week.\n",
      "When electricity is needed, the hot molten salt is pumped to a conventional steam-generator to produce superheated steam for driving a conventional turbine/generator set as used in any coal, oil or nuclear power plant.\n",
      "A 100-megawatt turbine would need a tank of about 9.1 metres (30 ft) tall and 24 metres (79 ft) in diameter to drive it for four hours by this design.A single tank with a divider plate to separate cold and hot molten salt is under development.\n",
      "It is more economical by achieving 100% more heat storage per unit volume over the dual tanks system as the molten-salt storage tank is costly due to its complicated construction.\n",
      "Most solar thermal power plants use this thermal energy storage concept.Phase Change Material (PCMs) are also used in molten-salt energy storage, while research on obtaining shape-stabilized PCMs using high porosity matrices is ongoing.\n",
      "The Solana Generating Station in the U.S. can store 6 hours worth of generating capacity in molten salt.\n",

      "Because latent heat storage (LHS ) is associated with a phase transition, the general term for the associated media is Phase-Change Material (PCM).\n",
      "During these transitions, heat can be added or extracted without affecting the material’s temperature, giving it an advantage over SHS-technologies.\n",
      "Storage capacities are often higher as well.\n",
      "There are a multitude of PCMs available, including but not limited to salts, polymers, gels, paraffin waxes and metal alloys, each with different properties.\n",
      "This allows for a more target-oriented system design.\n",
      "As the process is isothermal at the PCM’s melting point, the material can be picked to have the desired temperature range.\n",
      "Desirable qualities include high latent heat and thermal conductivity.\n",
      "Furthermore, the storage unit can be more compact if volume changes during the phase transition are small.\n",
      "PCMs are further subdivided into organic, inorganic and eutectic materials.\n"

      "In physics, potential energy is the energy held by an object because of its position relative to other objects, stresses within itself, its electric charge or other factors.\n",
      "The term potential energy was introduced by the 19th-century Scottish engineer and physicist William Rankine and has links to the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle's concept of potentiality.\n",
      "Common types of potential energy include the gravitational potential energy of an object, the elastic potential energy ( elastic potential of an extended spring ), and the electric potential energy in an electric field.\n",
      "The unit for energy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule (symbol J).\n",
      "Potential energy is associated with forces that act on a body in a way that the total work done by these forces on the body depends only on the initial and final positions of the body in space.\n",
      "These forces, whose total work is path independent, are called conservative forces.\n",
      "If the force acting on a body varies over space, then one has a force field; such a field is described by vectors at every point in space, which is in turn called a vector field.\n",
      "A conservative vector field can be simply expressed as the gradient of a certain scalar function, called a scalar potential.\n",
      "The potential energy is related to, and can be obtained from, this potential function.\n",
      "There are various types of potential energy, each associated with a particular type of force.== Overview ==\n",
      "For example, the work of an elastic force is called elastic potential energy; work of the gravitational force or weak nuclear force acting on the baryon charge is called nuclear potential energy.The work of intermolecular forces is called intermolycular potential energy.\n",
      "Chemical potential energy, such as the energy stored in fossil fuels, is the work of the Coulomb force during rearrangement of configurations of electrons and nuclei in atoms and molecules.\n",
      "Thermal energy usually has two components: the kinetic energy of random motions of particles and the potential energy of their configuration.\n",
      "Forces derivable from a potential are also called conservative forces.\n",
      "The work done by a conservative force is characterized by a change in the potential energy associated with the force.The change in potential energy is called the change in energy of the force, and the change is referred to as the change of potential energy.\n",
      "The negative sign provides the convention that work done against a force field increases potential energy, while work done by the force field decreases potential energy.\n",
      "Common notations for potential energy are PE, U, V, and Ep.\n",
      "Potential energy is the energy by virtue of an object's position relative to other objects.\n",
      "Potential energy is often associated with restoring forces such as a spring or the force of gravity.\n",
      "The action of stretching a spring or lifting a mass is performed by an external force that works against the force field of the potential.\n",
      "This work is stored in the force field, which is said to be stored as potential energy.\n",
      "If the external force is removed the force field acts on the body to perform the work as it moves the body back to the initial position, reducing the stretch of the spring or causing a body to fall.\n",
      "Consider a ball whose mass is m and whose height is h. The acceleration g of free fall is approximately constant, so the weight force of the ball mg is constant.\n",
      "The more formal definition is that potential energy is the energy difference between the energy of an object in a given position and its energy at a reference position.The product of force and displacement gives the work done, which is equal to the gravitational potential energy of the object in the given position.\n",
      "Potential energy is closely linked with forces.== Work and potential energy ==\n",
      "If the work done by a force on a body that moves from A to B does not depend on the path between these points (if the work is done by conservative force ) then the work of this force measured from A assigns a scalar value to every other point in space and defines a potential field.\n",
      "In this case, the force can be defined as the negative of the vector gradient of the potential field.\n",
      "If the work for an applied force is independent of the path, then the work done by the force is evaluated from the start to the end of the trajectory of the point of application.\n",
      "This means that there is a function U(x ) called a \"potential\" that can be evaluated at the two points xA and xB to obtain the work over any trajectory between these two points.\n",
      "It is tradition to define this function with a negative sign so that positive work is a reduction in the potential, that is where C is the trajectory taken from A to B.\n",
      "Because the work done is independent of the path taken, then this expression is true for any trajectory, C, from A to B.\n",
      "The function U(x) is called the potential energy associated with the applied force.\n",
      "Examples of forces that have potential energies are gravity and spring forces.\n",
      "In this section the relationship between work and potential energy is presented in more detail.=== Derivable from a potential ===\n",
      "The work of forces along a curve C is computed by evaluating the scalar field at the start point A and the end point B of the curve.The line integral that defines work along curve C takes a special form if the force F is related to a scalar fields U′(x ).This means that the units of U′ must be this case, work along the curve is given by\n",
      "This means the work integral does not depend on the path between A and B and is said to be independent of the path.\n",
      "Potential energy U = −U′(x) is traditionally defined as the negative of this scalar field so that work by the force field decreases potential energy, that is, the force F is said to be derived from a potential.In this case, the application of the del operator to the work function yields,\n",
      "This also necessarily implies that F must be a conservative vector field.\n",
      "The potential U defines a force F at every point x in space, so the set of forces is called a force field.\n",
      "Given a force field F(x), evaluation of the work integral using the gradient theorem can be used to find the scalar function associated with potential energy.=== Computing potential energy ===\n",
      "The power applied to a body by a force field is obtained from the gradient of the work, or potential, in the direction of the velocity v of the point of application, that is, the force applied to the body by the force field F.This is done by introducing a parameterized curve γ(t) = r(t ) from γ (a) = A to B, and computing the potential function from this curve.For example, for the force\n",

      "Appointed by the Second Continental Congress as commander of the Continental Army in June 1775, Washington led Patriot forces to victory in the American Revolutionary War and then served as president of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, which drafted and ratified the Constitution of the United States and established the American federal government.\n",
      "Washington has thus been called the \"Father of his Country\".\n",
      "Washington's first public office, from 1749 to 1750, was as surveyor of Culpeper County in the Colony of Virginia.\n",
      "He subsequently received military training and was assigned command of the Virginia Regiment during the French and Indian War.\n",
      "He was later elected to the Virginia House of Burgesses and was named a delegate to the Continental Congress in Philadelphia, which appointed him Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army.\n",
      "Washington led American forces to a decisive victory over the British in the Revolutionary War, leading the British to sign the Treaty of Paris, which acknowledged the sovereignty and independence of the United States.\n",
      "He resigned his commission in 1783 after the conclusion of the Revolutionary War.\n",
      "Washington played an indispensable role in adopting and ratifying the Constitution, which replaced the Articles of Confederation in 1789.\n",
      "He was then twice elected president by the Electoral College unanimously.\n",
      "As the first U.S. president, Washington implemented a strong and well-financed national government while remaining impartial in a fierce rivalry that emerged between cabinet members Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton.\n",
      "During the French Revolution, he proclaimed a policy of neutrality while sanctioning the Jay Treaty.\n",
      "He set enduring precedents for the office of president, including use of the title \"Mr. President\" and the two-term tradition.\n",
      "His 1796 farewell address became a preeminent statement on republicanism in which he wrote about the importance of national unity and the dangers regionalism, partisanship and foreign influence pose to it.\n",
      "Washington has been memorialized by monuments, a federal holiday, various media depictions, geographical locations including the national capital, the State of Washington, stamps, and currency.\n",
      "He is ranked among the greatest U.S. presidents.\n",
      "In 1976, Washington was posthumously promoted to the rank of General of the Armies, the highest rank in the U.S. Army.\n",
      "His legacy has become increasingly controversial over time, however, as a result of his ownership of slaves and his relationship with slavery.\n",
      "His historical reputation has also been complicated in modern discourse by his policy of assimilating Native Americans into Anglo-American culture and waging war against indigenous peoples during the Revolutionary War and the Northwest Indian War.\n",
      "George Washington was born on February 22, 1732, at Popes Creek in Westmoreland County, Virginia.== Early life (1732–1752) ==\n",

      "The family moved to Little Hunting Creek in 1734 before eventually settling in Ferry Farm near Fredericksburg, Virginia.\n",
      "When Augustine died in 1743, Washington inherited Ferry Farm and ten slaves; his older half-brother Lawrence inherited Little Hunting Creek and renamed it Mount Vernon.Washington did not have the formal education his elder brothers received at Appleby Grammar School in England, but he did attend the Lower Church School in Hartfield.\n",
      "He learned mathematics, trigonometry and land surveying, and became a talented draftsman and mapmaker.\n",
      "By early adulthood, he was writing with \"considerable force\" and \"precision\".\n",
      "As a teenager, to practice his penmanship, Washington compiled over a hundred rules for social interaction styled Rules of Civility and Decent Behaviour in Company and Conversation, copied from an English translation of a French book of manners.Washington often visited Mount Vernon and Belvoir, the plantation of William Fairfax, Lawrence's father-in-law.\n",
      "Fairfax became Washington's patron and surrogate father and Washington spent a month in 1748 with a team surveying Fairfax's Shenandoah Valley property.\n",
      "The following year, he received a surveyor's license from the College of William & Mary.\n",
      "Even though Washington had not served the customary apprenticeship, Fairfax appointed him surveyor of Culpeper County, Virginia, where he took his oath of office July 20, 1749.\n",
      "He subsequently familiarized himself with the frontier region and though he resigned from the job in 1750, he continued to do surveys west of the Blue Ridge Mountains.\n",
      "By 1752, he had bought almost 1,500 acres (600 ha) in the Valley and owned 2,315 acres (937 ha).In 1751, Washington made his only trip abroad when he accompanied Lawrence to Barbados, hoping the climate would cure his brother's tuberculosis.\n",
      "Washington contracted smallpox during that trip, which left his face slightly scarred.\n",
      "Lawrence died in 1752, and Washington leased Mount Vernon from his widow Anne; he inherited it outright after her death in 1761.\n",
      "Lawrence Washington's service as adjutant general of the Virginia militia inspired George to seek a commission.== Colonial military career (1752–1758) ==\n",
      "Virginia's lieutenant governor, Robert Dinwiddie, appointed Washington as a major and commander of one of the four militia districts.\n",
      "The British and French were competing for control of the Ohio Valley: the British were constructing forts along the Ohio River and the French between the Ohio and Lake Erie.In October 1753, Dinwiddie appointed Washington as a special envoy.\n",
      "He had sent Washington to demand French forces to vacate land that was claimed by the British.\n",
      "Washington was also appointed to make peace with the Iroquois Confederacy and to gather further intelligence about the French forces.\n",
      "Washington met with Half-King Tanacharison, and other Iroquois chiefs, at Logstown, and gathered information about the numbers and locations of the French forts, as well as intelligence concerning individuals taken prisoner by the French.\n",
      "Washington was nicknamed Conotocaurius by Tanacharison.\n",
      "The name, meaning \"devourer of villages\", had been given to his great-grandfather John Washington in the late 17th century by the Susquehannock.Washington's party reached the Ohio River in November 1753, and was intercepted by a French patrol.\n",
      "The party was escorted to Fort Le Boeuf, where Washington was received in a friendly manner.\n",
      "He delivered the British demand to vacate to the French commander Saint-Pierre, but the French refused to leave.\n",
      "Saint-Pierre gave Washington his official answer after a few days' delay, as well as food and winter clothing for his party's journey back to Virginia.\n",
      "Washington completed the precarious mission in 77 days, in difficult winter conditions, achieving a measure of distinction when his report was published in Virginia and London.\n",
      "In February 1754, Dinwiddie promoted Washington to lieutenant colonel and second-in-command of the 300-strong Virginia Regiment, with orders to confront French forces at the Forks of the Ohio.=== French and Indian War ===\n",
      "Washington set out with half the regiment in April and soon learned a French force of 1,000 had begun construction of Fort Duquesne there.\n",
      "In May, having set up a defensive position at Great Meadows, he learned that the French had made camp seven miles (11 km) away; he decided to take the offensive.The French detachment proved to be only about 50 men, so Washington advanced on May 28 with a small force of Virginians and Indian allies to ambush them.\n",
      "During the ambush, French forces were killed outright with muskets and hatchets, including French commander Joseph Coulon de Jumonville, who had been carrying a diplomatic message for the British.\n",
      "The full Virginia Regiment joined Washington at Fort Necessity the following month with news that he had been promoted to command of the regiment and colonel upon the regimental commander's death.The French later found their countrymen dead and scalped, blaming Washington, who had retreated to Fort Nucessity.\n",
      "The regiment was reinforced by an independent company of a hundred South Carolinians led by Captain James Mackay; his royal commission outranked Washington's and a conflict of command ensued.\n",
      "On July 3, a French force attacked with 900 men, and the ensuing battle ended in Washington's surrender.\n",
      "In the aftermath, Colonel James Innes took command of intercolonial forces, the Virginia Regiment was divided and Washington was offered a captaincy in one of the newly formed regiments.He signed a surrender document in which he unwittingly took responsibility for \"assassinating\" Jumonville, later blaming the translator for not properly translating it.\n",
      "He refused, however, as it would have been a demotion and instead resigned his commission.\n",
      "The \"Jumonville affair\" became the incident which ignited the French and Indian War, later to become part of the Seven Years' War.\n",
      "In 1755, Washington served voluntarily as an aide to General Edward Braddock, who led a British expedition to expel the French from Fort Duquesne and the Ohio Country.\n",
      "On Washington's recommendation, Braddock split the army into one main column and a lightly equipped \"flying column\".\n",
      "Suffering from severe dysentery, Washington was left behind at Monongahela the French and their Indian allies ambushed the divided army.\n",

      "Behind the head is a smooth, robust pronotum.\n",
      "The abdomen ends in a pair of long cerci; females have a long, cylindrical ovipositor.\n",
      "Diagnostic features include legs with 3-segmented tarsi; as with many Orthoptera, the hind legs have enlarged femora, providing power for jumping.\n",
      "The front wings are adapted as tough, leathery elytra, and some crickets chirp by rubbing parts of these together.\n",
      "The hind wings are membranous and folded when not in use for flight; many species, however, are flightless.\n",
      "The largest members of the family are the bull crickets, Brachytrupes, which are up to 5 cm (2 in) long.\n",
      "Crickets are distributed all around the world except at latitudes 55° or higher, with the greatest diversity being in the tropics.\n",
      "They occur in varied habitats from grassland, bushes, and forests to marshes, beaches, and caves.\n",
      "Crickets are mainly nocturnal and are best known for the loud, persistent, chirping song of males trying to attract females, although some species are mute.\n",
      "The singing species have good hearing, via the tympana on the tibiae of the front legs.\n",
      "Crickets often appear as characters in literature.\n",
      "The Talking Cricket features in Carlo Collodi's 1883 children's book, The Adventures of Pinocchio and in films based on the book.\n",

      "Crickets are small to medium-sized insects with mostly cylindrical, somewhat vertically flattened bodies.== Description ==\n",
      "The head is spherical with long slender antennae arising from cone-shaped scapes (first segments) and just behind these are two large compound eyes.\n",
      "On the forehead are three ocelli (simple eyes).\n",
      "The pronotum (first thoracic segment) is trapezoidal in shape, robust, and well-sclerotized.\n",
      "It is smooth and has neither dorsal nor lateral keels (ridges).At the tip of the abdomen is a pair of long cerci (paired appendages on rearmost segment ) and in females, the ovipositor is cylindrical, long and narrow, smooth and shiny.\n",
      "The femora (third segments) of the back pair of legs are greatly enlarged for jumping.\n",
      "The tibiae (fourth segments) of the hind legs are armed with a number of moveable spurs, the arrangement of which is characteristic of each species.\n",
      "The tibiae of the front legs bear one or more tympani which are used for the reception of sound.The wings lie flat on the body and are very variable in size between species, being reduced in size in some crickets and missing in others.\n",
      "The fore wings are elytra made of tough chitin, acting as a protective shield for the soft parts of the body and in males, bear the stridulatory organs for the production of sound.\n",
      "The hind pair is membranous, folding fan-wise under the fore wings.\n",
      "The largest members of the family are the 5 cm (2 in)-long bull crickets (Brachytrupes) which excavate burrows a metre or more deep.In many species, the wings are not adapted for flight.\n",
      "The tree crickets (Oecanthinae ) are delicate white or pale green insects with transparent fore wings, while the field crickets are robust brown or black insects.\n",
      "Crickets have a cosmopolitan distribution, being found in all parts of the world with the exception of cold regions at latitudes higher than about 55° North and South.\n",
      "They have colonised many large and small islands, sometimes flying over the sea to reach these locations, or perhaps conveyed on floating timber or by human activity.\n",
      "The greatest diversity occurs in tropical locations such as in Malaysia where 88 species were heard chirping from a single location near Kuala Lumpur.\n",
      "Crickets are found in many habitats.A greater number than this could have been present because some species are mute.\n",
      "Members of several subfamilies are found in the upper tree canopy, in bushes and among grasses and herbs.\n",
      "They also occur on the ground and in caves, and some are subterranean, excavating shallow or deep burrows.\n",
      "Some make home in rotting wood, and certain beach-dwelling species can run and jump over the surface of water.\n",
      "Crickets are relatively defenceless, soft-bodied insects.== Biology == Defence ===\n",
      "Most species are nocturnal and spend the day hidden in cracks, under bark, inside curling leaves, under stones or fallen logs, in leaf litter or in the cracks in the ground that develop in dry weather.\n",
      "Some excavate their own shallow holes in rotting wood or underground and fold in their antennae to conceal their presence.\n",
      "Some of these burrows are temporary shelters, used for a single day, but others serve as more permanent residences and places for mating and laying eggs.\n",
      "Crickets burrow by loosening the soil with the mandibles and then carrying it with the limbs, flicking it backwards with the hind legs or pushing it forward with the head.Other defensive strategies are the use of camouflage, fleeing, and aggression.\n",
      "Some species have adopted colourings, shapes and patterns that make it difficult for predators that hunt by sight to detect them.\n",
      "They tend to be dull shades of brown, grey, and green that blend into their background, and desert species tend to have pale skin.\n",
      "Some species can fly, but the mode of flight tends to be clumsy, so the most usual response to danger is to scuttle away to find a hiding place.\n",
      "While some crickets have a weak bite, a member of the Gryllacrididae or raspy crickets from Australia were found to have the strongest bite of any insect.\n",
      "Most male crickets make a loud chirping sound by stridulation (scraping two specially textured body parts together).\n",
      "The stridulatory organ is located on the tegmen, or fore wing, which is leathery in texture.\n",
      "A large vein runs along the centre of each tegmen, with comb-like serrations on its edge forming a file-like structure and at the rear edge of the scrapers is a scraper.\n",
      "The tegmina are held at an angle to the body and rhythmically raised and lowered which causes the scraper on one wing to rasp on the file on the other.\n",
      "The central part of the tegmen contains the \"harp\", an area of thick, sclerotized membrane which resonates and amplifies the volume of sound as does the pocket of air between the body wall.\n",
      "Most female crickets lack the necessary adaptations to stridulate, so make no sound.Several types of cricket songs are in the repertoire of some species.\n",
      "The calling song attracts females and repels other males, and is fairly loud.\n",
      "The courting song is used when a female cricket is near and encourages her to mate with the caller.\n",
      "A triumphal song is produced for a brief period after a successful mating and may reinforce the mating bond to encourage the female to lay some eggs rather than find another male.\n",
      "Crickets chirp at different rates depending on their species and the temperature of their environment.An aggressive song is triggered by contact chemoreceptors on the antennae that detect the presence of another male cricket.\n",
      "Most species chirp at higher rates the higher the temperature is (about 62 chirps a minute at 13 °C (55 °F) in one common species; each species has its own rate).\n",
      "The relationship between temperature and the rate of chirping is known as Dolbear's law.\n",
      "According to this law, counting the number of chirps produced in 14 seconds by the snowy tree cricket, common in the United States and adding 40 will approximate the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.\n",
      "In 1975, Dr. William H. Cade discovered that the parasitic tachinid fly Ormia ochracea is attracted to the song of the cricket, and uses it to locate the male to deposit her larvae on him.\n",
      "It was the first known example of a natural enemy that locates its host or prey using the mating signal.\n",
      "Since then, many species of crickets have been found to be carrying the same parasitic fly, or related species.\n",
      "In response to this selective pressure, a mutation leaving males unable to chirp was observed amongst a population of Teleogryllus oceanicus on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, enabling these crickets to elude their parasitoid predators.\n",
      "A different mutation with the same effect was also discovered on the neighboring island of Oahu (ca.\n",
      "100 miles (160 km) away).\n",
      "Recently, new \"purring\" males of the same species in Hawaii are able to produce a novel auditory sexual signal that can be used to attract females while greatly reducing the likelihood of parasitoid attack from the fly.\n",
      "Some species, such as the ground crickets (Nemobiinae ) are wingless; others have small fore wings and no hind wings (Copholandrevus), others lack hind wings and have shortened fore wings in females only, while others are macropterous, with the hind wings longer than the fore wings.=== Flight ===\n",
      "In Teleogryllus, the proportion of macropterous individuals varies from very low to 100%.\n"

      "The Laws of the Game are the codified rules of association football.\n",
      "The laws mention the number of players a team should have, the game length, the size of the field and ball, the type and nature of fouls that referees may penalise, the offside law, and many other laws that define the sport.\n",
      "During a match, it is the task of the referee to interpret and enforce the Laws of the Game.\n",
      "There were various attempts to codify rules among the various types of football in the mid-19th century.\n",
      "The extant Laws date back to 1863 where a ruleset was formally adopted by the newly formed Football Association (FA) and written by its first secretary, Ebenezer Cobb Morley.\n",
      "Over time, the Laws have been amended and since 1886 they have been maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).\n",
      "The Laws are the only rules of association football FIFA permits its members to use.\n",
      "The Laws currently allow some minor optional variations which can be implemented by national football associations, including some for play at the lowest levels, but otherwise almost all organised football worldwide is played under the same ruleset.\n",
      "Within the United States, Major League Soccer used a distinct ruleset during the 1990s and the National Federation of State High School Associations and National Collegiate Athletic Association still use rulesets that are comparable to, but different from, the IFAB Laws.\n",
      "The Laws of the Game consist of seventeen individual laws, each law containing several rules and directions:Law 1: The Field of PlayLaw 2: The BallLaw 3: The PlayersLaw 4: The EquipmentLaw 5: The RefereeLaw 6: The Other Match OfficialsLaw 7: The Duration of the Match\n",
      "All high-level association football is played according to the same laws.Law 9: The Ball In and Out of Play                Law 10: Determining the Outcome of a Match\n",
      "The Laws permit some variation for youth, veterans, disability and grassroots football, such as shortening the length of the game and the use of temporary dismissals.\n",
      "In 1997, a major revision dropped whole paragraphs and clarified many sections to simplify and strengthen the principles.=== Presentation and interpretation ===\n",
      "These laws are written in English Common Law style and are meant to be guidelines and goals of principle that are then clarified through practice, tradition and enforcement by the referees.\n",
      "The actual law book had long contained 50 pages more of material, organised in numerous sections that included many diagrams but were not officially part of the main 17 laws.\n",
      "In 2007, many of these additional sections along with much of the material from the FIFA Questions and Answers (Q&A), were restructured and put into a new \"Additional Instructions and Guidelines for the Referee\" section.\n",
      "In the 2016/2017 revision of the Laws, the material from this section was folded into the Laws themselves.\n",
      "Referees are expected to use their judgement and common sense in applying the laws; this is colloquially known as \"Law 18\".\n",

      "They meet at least once a year to debate and decide any changes to the text as it exists at that time.\n",
      "The meeting in winter generally leads to an update to the laws on 1 July of each year that take effect immediately.\n",
      "The laws govern all international matches and national matches of member organisations.\n",
      "A minimum of six of the eight-seat IFAB board needs to vote to accept a rule change.\n",
      "Four seats are held by FIFA to represent their 200+ member Nations, with the other four going to each of the British associations (the FA representing England, the SFA representing Scotland, FAW representing Wales and the IFA representing Northern Ireland), meaning that no change can be made without FIFA's approval, but FIFA cannot change the Laws without the approval of at least two British governing bodies.\n",
      "In the nineteenth century, the word \"football\" could signify a wide variety of games in which players attempted to move a ball into an opponent's goal.== History ===== Pre-1863 ===\n",
      "The first published rules of \"football\" were those of Rugby School (1845), which permitted extensive handling of the ball, quickly followed by the Eton field game (1847), which was much more restrictive of handling the ball.\n",
      "Between the 1830s and 1850s, a number of sets of rules were created for use at Cambridge University – but they were generally not published at the time and many have subsequently been lost.\n",
      "The first detailed sets of rules published by football clubs (rather than a school or university) were those of Sheffield F.C.\n",
      "(written 1858, published 1859) which codified a game played for 20 years until being discontinued in favour of the Football Association code, and those of Melbourne FC (1859 ) which are the origins of Australian rules football.\n",
      "By the time the Football Association met in late 1863, many different sets of rules had been published, varying widely on such questions as the extent to which the ball could be handled, the treatment of offside, the amount of physical contact allowed with opponents and the height at which a goal could be scored.\n",
      "In 1863, some football clubs followed the example of Rugby School by allowing the ball to be carried in the hands, with players allowed to \"hack\" (kick in the shins) opponents who were carrying the ball.=== 1863 rules ===\n",
      "Other clubs forbade both practices.\n",
      "During the FA meetings to draw up the first version of the laws, there was an acrimonious division between the \"hacking\" and \"non-hacking\n",
      "An FA meeting of 17 November 1863 discussed this question, with the \"hacking\" clubs predominating.\n",
      "A further meeting was scheduled in order to finalise (\"settle\") the laws.\n",
      "At this crucial 24 November meeting, the \"hackers\" were again in a narrow majority.\n",
      "During the meeting, however, the FA's secretary Ebenezer Cobb Morley brought the delegates' attention to a recently published set of football laws from Cambridge University which banned carrying and hacking.\n",
      "Discussion of the Cambridge rules and suggestions for possible communication with Cambridge on the subject, served to delay the final \"settlement\" of the laws to a further meeting, on 1 December.\n",
      "Francis Campbell of Blackheath F.C., the most prominent \"hacking\" club, accused FA President Arthur Pember, Morley, and their allies of managing 24 November meeting improperly in order to prevent the \"pro-Hacking\" laws from being adopted.A number of representatives who supported rugby-style football did not attend this additional meeting, resulting in hacking and carrying being banned.\n",
      "Pember strongly denied such an \"accusation of ungentlemanly conduct\".\n",
      "The verdicts of later historians have been mixed:  Young accuses Campbell of \"arrogance\", while Harvey supports Campbell's allegations, accusing the non-hackers of a \"coup\" against the pro-hacking clubs.\n",
      "Blackheath, along with the other \"hacking\" clubs, would leave the FA as a result of this dispute.\n",
      "The final version of the FA's laws was formally adopted and published in December 1863.\n",
      "There was no crossbar.Some notable differences from the modern game are listed below:\n",
      "Goals could be scored at any height (as today in Australian rules football).\n",
      "While most forms of handling were forbidden, players were allowed to catch the ball (provided they did not run with it or throw it).\n",
      "A fair catch was rewarded with a free kick (a feature that today survives in various forms in Australian rules football, rugby union and American football).\n",
      "There was a strict offside rule, under which any player ahead of the kicker was in an offside position (similar to today's offside rules in rugby union).\n",
      "The only exception was when the ball was kicked from behind the goal line.\n",
      "The throw-in was awarded to the first player (on either team) to touch the ball after it went out of play.\n",
      "The ball had to be thrown in at right-angles to the touchline (as today in rugby union).\n",
      "There was no corner-kick.\n",
      "When the ball went behind the goal-line, there was a situation somewhat similar to rugby: if an attacking player first touched the ball after it went out of play then the attacking team had an opportunity to take a free kick at goal from a point fifteen yards behind the point where the ball was touched (somewhat similar to a conversion in rugby).\n",
      "If a defender first touched the ball, then the defending team kicked the ball out from on or behind the goal line (equivalent to the goal-kick).\n",
      "Teams changed ends every time a goal was scored.\n",
      "The rules made no provision for a goal-keeper, match officials, punishments for infringements of the rules, duration of the match, half-time, number of players, or pitch-markings (other than flags to mark the boundary of the playing area).At its meeting on 8 December 1863, the FA agreed that, as reported in Bell's Life in London, John Lillywhite would publish the Laws.\n",
      "The first game to be played under the new rules occurred eleven days later between Barnes and Richmond.\n",
      "Adoption of the laws was not universal among English football clubs.\n",
      "The Sheffield Rules continued to be used by many.\n",
      "Rugby Football was founded in 1871 and was the first professional association football club in the United Kingdom.In its early years it was not part of the Football Association and was known for hacking as well as handling of the ball.Several clubs, such as Blackheath, decided against being involved in the FA in its early days and would later form the Rugby Football Union.\n"

      "The distinction was emphasized by artists of the Arts and Crafts Movement, who valued vernacular art forms as much as high forms.\n",
      "Art schools made a distinction between the fine arts and the crafts, maintaining that a craftsperson could not be considered a practitioner of the arts.\n",
      "The increasing tendency to privilege painting, and to a lesser degree sculpture, above other arts has been a feature of Western art as well as East Asian art.\n",
      "In both regions, painting has been seen as relying to the highest degree on the imagination of the artist and being the furthest removed from manual labour – in Chinese painting, the most highly valued styles were those of \"scholar-painting\", at least in theory practiced by gentleman amateurs.\n",

      "Another example is mosaic of the Battle of Issus at Pompeii, which was probably based on a Greek painting.\n",
      "Greek and Roman art contributed to Byzantine art in the 4th century BC, which initiated a tradition in icon painting.\n",
      "Apart from the illuminated manuscripts produced by monks during the Middle Ages, the next significant contribution to European art was from Italy's renaissance painters.==== The Renaissance ====\n",
      "From Giotto in the 13th century to Leonardo da Vinci and Raphael at the beginning of the 16th century, this was the richest period in Italian art as the chiaroscuro techniques were used to create the illusion of 3-D space.\n",
      "Painters in northern Europe too were influenced by the Italian school.\n",
      "Jan van Eyck from Belgium, Pieter Bruegel the Elder from the Netherlands and Hans Holbein the Younger from Germany are among the most successful painters of the times.\n",
      "They used the glazing technique with oils to achieve depth and luminosity.\n",
      "The 17th century witnessed the emergence of the great Dutch masters such as the versatile Rembrandt who was especially remembered for his portraits and Bible scenes, and Vermeer who specialized in interior scenes of Dutch life.==== Dutch masters ====\n",
      "The Baroque started after the Renaissance, from the late 16th century to the late 17th century.=====The Renaissance ====Baroque ====\n",
      "Main artists of the Baroque included Caravaggio, who made heavy use of tenebrism.\n",
      "Peter Paul Rubens was a Flemish painter who studied in Italy and worked for local churches in Antwerp and also painted a series for Marie de' Medici.\n",

      "Much of what defines the Baroque is dramatic lighting and overall visuals.\n",
      "Impressionism began in France in the 19th century with a loose association of artists including Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Paul Cézanne who brought a new freely brushed style to painting, often choosing to paint realistic scenes of modern life outside rather than in the studio.==== Impressionism ====\n",
      "This was achieved through a new expression of aesthetic features demonstrated by brush strokes and the impression of reality.\n",
      "They achieved intense color vibration by using pure, unmixed colors and short brush strokes.\n",
      "The movement influenced art as a dynamic, moving through time and adjusting to newfound techniques and perception of art.\n",
      "Attention to detail became less of a priority in achieving, whilst exploring a biased view of landscapes and nature to the artist's eye.\n",
      "Towards the end of the 19th century, several young painters took impressionism a stage further, using geometric forms and unnatural color to depict emotions while striving for deeper symbolism.==== Post-impressionism ====\n",
      "Of particular note are Paul Gauguin who was strongly influenced by Asian, African and Japanese art, Vincent van Gogh, a Dutchman who moved to France where he drew on the strong sunlight of the south and Toulouse-Lautrec, remembered for his vivid paintings of night life in the Paris district of Montmartre.\n",
      "Edvard Munch, a Norwegian artist, developed his symbolistic approach at the end of the 19th century, inspired by the French impressionist Manet.==== Symbolism, expressionism and cubism ====\n",
      "The Scream (1893), his most famous work, is widely interpreted as representing the universal anxiety of modern man.\n",
      "Partly as a result of Munch's influence, the German expressionist movement originated in Germany at the beginning of the 20th century as artists such as Ernst Kirschner and Erich Heckel began to distort reality for an emotional effect.\n",
      "In parallel, the style known as cubism developed in France as artists focused on the volume and space of sharp structures within a composition.\n"

      "The social network perspective provides a set of methods for analyzing the structure of whole social entities as well as a variety of theories explaining the patterns observed in these structures.\n",
      "The study of these structures uses social network analysis to identify local and global patterns, locate influential entities, and examine network dynamics.\n",
      "Social networks and the analysis of them is an inherently interdisciplinary academic field which emerged from social psychology, sociology, statistics and graph theory.\n",
      "Georg Simmel authored early structural theories in sociology emphasizing the dynamics of triads and \"web of group affiliations\".\n",
      "Jacob Moreno is credited with developing the first sociograms in the 1930s to study interpersonal relationships.\n",
      "These approaches were mathematically formalized in the 1950s and theories and methods of social networks became pervasive in the social and behavioral sciences by the 1980s.\n",
      "Social network analysis is now one of the major paradigms in contemporary sociology and is also employed in a number of other social and formal sciences.\n",
      "Together with other complex networks, it forms part of the nascent field of network science.\n",
      "The social network is a theoretical construct useful in the social sciences to study relationships between individuals, groups, organizations or even entire societies (social units, see differentiation).\n",
      "The term is used to describe a social structure determined by such interactions.\n",
      "The ties through which any given social unit connects represent the convergence of the various social contacts of that unit.\n",
      "This theoretical approach is, necessarily, relational.\n",
      "An axiom of the social network approach to understanding social interaction is that social phenomena should be primarily conceived and investigated through the properties of relations between and within units, instead of properties of these units themselves.\n",
      "Social network theory is often criticized for ignoring individual agency although this may not be the case in practice (see agent-based modeling).Thus, one common criticism of social networks theory is that individual agency is often ignored.\n",
      "Precisely because many different types of relations, singular or in combination, form these network configurations, network analytics are useful to a broad range of research enterprises.\n",
      "In social science, these fields of study include, but are not limited to anthropology, biology, communication studies, economics, geography, information science, organizational studies, social psychology, sociology and sociolinguistics.\n",
      "In the late 1890s, both Émile Durkheim and Ferdinand Tönnies foreshadowed the idea of social networks in their theories and research of social groups.== History ==\n",
      "Tönnies argued that social groups can exist as personal and direct social ties that either link individuals who share values and belief (Gemeinschaft, German, commonly translated as \"community\") or impersonal, formal and instrumental social links (Gesellschaft, German, commonly translated to \"society\").\n",
      "Durkheim gave a non-individualistic explanation of social facts, arguing that social phenomena arise when interacting individuals constitute a reality that can no longer be accounted for in terms of the properties of individual actors.\n",
      "Georg Simmel, writing at the turn of the twentieth century, pointed to the nature of networks and the effect of network size on interaction and examined the likelihood of interaction in loosely knit networks rather than groups.\n",
      "Major developments in the field can be seen in the 1930s by several groups in psychology, anthropology and mathematics working independently.\n",
      "In psychology, in the 1930s, Jacob L. Moreno began systematic recording and analysis of social interaction in small groups especially classrooms and work groups (see sociometry).\n",
      "In anthropology, the foundation for social network theory is the theoretical and ethnographic work of Bronislaw Malinowski, Alfred Radcliffe-Brown and Claude Lévi-Strauss.\n",
      "A group of social anthropologists associated with Max Gluckman and the Manchester School, including John A. Barnes, J. Clyde Mitchell and Elizabeth Bott Spillius, often are credited with performing some of the first fieldwork from which network analyses were performed, investigating community networks in southern Africa, India and the United Kingdom.\n",
      "Concomitantly, British anthropologist S. F. Nadel codified a theory of social structure that was influential in later network analysis.\n",
      "In sociology, the early (1930s) work of Talcott Parsons set the stage for taking a relational approach to understanding social structure.\n",
      "By the 1970s a growing number of scholars worked to combine the different tracks and traditions.Later, drawing upon Parsons' theory, the work of sociologist Peter Blau provides a strong impetus for analyzing the relational ties of social units with his work on social exchange theory.\n",
      "One group consisted of sociologist Harrison White and his students at the Harvard University Department of Social Relations.\n",
      "Also independently active in the Harvard Social Relations department at the time were Charles Tilly, who focused on networks in political and community sociology and social movements and Stanley Milgram, who developed the \"six degrees of separation\" thesis.\n",
      "Mark Granovetter and Barry Wellman are among the former students of White who elaborated and championed the analysis of social networks.Beginning in the late 1990s, social network analysis experienced work by sociologists, political scientists and physicists such as Duncan J. Watts, Albert-László Barabási, Peter Bearman, Nicholas A. Christakis, James H. Fowler, and others, developing and applying new models and methods to emerging data available about online social\n",
      "In general, social networks are self-organizing, emergent, and complex, such that a globally coherent pattern appears from the local interaction of the elements that make up the system.== Levels of analysis ==\n",
      "These patterns become more apparent as network size increases.\n",
      "However, a global network analysis of all interpersonal relationships in the world is not feasible and is likely to contain so much information as to be uninformative.\n",
      "Practical limitations of computing power, ethics and participant recruitment and payment also limit the scope of a social network analysis.\n",
      "The nuances of a local system may be lost in a large network analysis, hence the quality of information may be more important than its scale for understanding network properties.\n",
      "Social networks are analyzed at the scale relevant to the researcher's theoretical question.\n",
      "Although levels of analysis are not necessarily mutually exclusive, there are three general levels into which networks may fall: micro-level, meso-level and macro-level.\n",
      "At the micro-level, social network research typically begins with an individual, snowballing as social relationships are traced or may begin with a small group of individuals in a particular social context.=== Micro level ===\n",

      "Triadic level: Add one individual to a dyad, and you have a triad.\n",
      "Research at this level may concentrate on factors such as balance and transitivity, as well as social equality and tendencies toward reciprocity/mutuality.\n",
      "In the balance theory of Fritz Heider the triad is the key to social dynamics.\n",

      "The study is carried forward with the theory of signed graphs.\n",
      "Actor level: The smallest unit of analysis in a social network is an individual in their social setting, i. e., an \"actor\" or \"ego.\"\n",
      "Egonetwork analysis focuses on network characteristics such as size, relationship strength, density, centrality, prestige and roles such as isolates, liaisons, and bridges.\n",
      "Such analyses are most commonly used in the fields of psychology or social psychology, ethnographic kinship analysis or other genealogical studies of relationships between individuals.\n",
      "Subset level: Subset levels of network research problems begin at the micro-level but may cross over into the meso-level of analysis.\n",
      "Subset level research may focus on distance and reachability, cliques, cohesive subgroups, or other group actions or behavior.\n",
      "In general, meso-level theories begin with a population size that falls between the micro- and macro-levels.=== Meso level ===\n",
      "The meso-level may also refer to analyses that are specifically designed to reveal connections between micro- and macro-levels.\n",

      "Filmmaking or film production is the process by which a motion picture is produced.\n",
      "Filmmaking involves a number of complex and discrete stages, beginning with an initial story, idea, or commission.\n",
      "Production then continues through screenwriting, casting, pre-production, shooting, sound recording, post-production and screening the finished product before an audience, which may result in a film release and exhibition.\n",
      "The process is nonlinear, as the director typically shoots the script out of sequence, repeats shots as needed, and puts them together through editing later.\n",
      "Filmmaking occurs in a variety of economic, social, and political contexts around the world and uses a wide range of technologies and cinematic techniques to make theatrical films, episodic films for television and streaming platforms, music videos and promotional and educations films.\n",
      "Although filmmaking originally involved the use of film, most film productions are now digital.\n",
      "Today, filmmaking refers to the process of crafting an audio-visual story commercially for distribution or broadcast.\n",
      "Film production consists of five major stages:Development: Ideas for the film are created, rights to existing intellectual properties are purchased, etc., and the screenplay is written.== Production stages ==\n",
      "Financing for the project is sought and obtained.\n",
      "Pre-production: Arrangements and preparations are made for the shoot, such as hiring cast and film crew, selecting locations, and constructing sets.\n",
      "Production: The raw footage and other elements of the film are recorded during the film shoot, including principal photography.\n",
      "Post-production: The images, sound and visual effects of the recorded film are edited and combined into a finished product.\n",
      "Distribution: The completed film is distributed, marketed, and screened in cinemas or released to home video to be viewed.\n",
      "The development stage contains both general and specific components.=== Development ===\n",
      "Each film studio has a yearly retreat where their top creative executives meet and interact on a variety of areas and topics they wish to explore through collaborations with producers and screenwriters and then ultimately, directors, actors and actresses.\n",
      "They choose trending topics from the media and real life, as well as many other sources to determine their yearly agenda.\n",
      "For example, in a year when action is popular, they may wish to explore that topic in one or more movies.\n",
      "Sometimes, they purchase the rights to articles, bestselling novels, plays, the remaking of older films, stories with some basis in real life through a person or event, a video game, fairy tale, comic book, graphic novel.\n",
      "Likewise, research through surveys may inform their decisions.\n",
      "They may have had blockbusters from their previous year and wish to explore a sequel.\n",
      "They will additionally acquire a completed and independently financed and produced film.\n",
      "Such notable examples are Little Miss Sunshine and The English Patient as well as Roma.\n",
      "Studios hold general meetings with producers and screenwriters about original story ideas.\n",
      "\"In my decade working as a writer, I knew of only a few that were sold and fewer that made it to the screen,\" relays writer Wayne Powers.\n",
      "Alan Watt, writer-director and Founder of The LA Writer's Lab confirmed that completed original screenplays, referred to as \"specs\", make big news when they sell but these make up a very small portion of movies that are ultimately given the green light to be produced by the president of a studio.\n",
      "The executives return from the retreat with fairly well-established instructions.\n",
      "They spread these concepts through the industry community, especially to producers they have deals with (traditional studios will have those producers in offices on their lots).\n",
      "Also, agents for screenwriters are made aware.\n",
      "This results in a pairing of producers with writers, where they develop a \"take\", a basic story idea that utilizes the concept given by studio executives.\n",
      "Often it is a competition with several pairings meeting with studio executives and \"pitching\" their \"take\".\n",
      "Very few writing jobs are from original ideas brought to studios by producers or writers.\n",
      "Perhaps one movie a year will be a \"spec\" script that was purchased.\n",
      "Once the producer and writer have sold their approach to the desired subject matter, they begin to work.\n",
      "However, many writers and producers usually pass before a particular concept is realized in a way that is awarded a green light to production.\n",
      "Production of Unforgiven, which earned Oscars for its Director/Star Clint Eastwood, as well as its screenwriter, David Webb Peoples, required fifteen years.\n",
      "Powers related that The Italian Job took approximately eight years from concept to screen, which, as Powers added, \"is average.\"\n",
      "And most concepts turned into paid screenplays wind up gathering dust on some executive's shelf, never to see production.\n",
      "Writers have different styles and creative processes; some have stronger track records than others.\n",
      "Because of this, how the development process proceeds from there and how much detail a writer returns to the studio to divulge before beginning writing can vary greatly.\n",
      "Screenwriters are often protected by the union, the Writers Guild of America, or WGA.\n",
      "The WGA allows a screenwriter to contract for One Draft, One Revision and One Polish.\n",
      "Bob Eisle, Writer and Member of the Guild Board, states, \"Additional writing requires an extension of contracts and payment for additional work\".\n",
      "They are paid 80% of their fee after the First Draft.\n",
      "Preliminary discussions are minimal with studio executives but might be quite detailed with the producer.\n",
      "Next, a screenwriter writes a screenplay over a period of several months or however long it takes.\n",
      "Deadlines are in their contracts but there is no pressure to adhere to them.\n",
      "Again, every writer's process and speed vary.\n",
      "The screenwriter may rewrite the script several times to improve dramatization, clarity, structure, characters, dialogue, and overall style.\n",
      "Script Coverage, a freelance job held by recent university graduates, does not feed scripts into the system that are ready for production nor already produced.\n",
      "\"Coverage\" is a way for young screenwriters to be read and their ideas might make their way up to an executive or famous producer and result in \"meet and greets\" where relations with up-and-comers can be formed.\n",
      "But it has not historically yielded ideas studios pursue into production.\n",
      "The studio is the film distributor who at an early stage attempts to choose a slate of concepts that are likely to have market appeal and find potential financial success.\n",
      "Hollywood distributors consider factors such as the film genre, the target audience and assumed audience, the historical success of similar films, the actors who might appear in the film and potential directors.\n",
      "All these factors imply a certain appeal of the film to a possible audience.\n",
      "Not all films make a profit from the theatrical release alone, however, the studio mainly targets the opening weekend and the second weekend to make most domestic profits.\n",
      "Occasionally a film called a \"word of mouth film\" does not market strongly but its success spreads by word of mouth.\n",
      "It slowly gains its audience.\n",
      "These are special circumstances and these films may remain in theaters for 5 months while a typical film run is closer to 5 weekends.\n",
      "Further earnings result from pay television purchases, foreign market purchases and DVD sales to establish worldwide distribution Gross of a Film.\n",
      "Once a screenplay is \"green-lit\", directors and actors are attached and the film proceeds into the pre-production stage, although sometimes development and production stages will overlap.\n",
      "Projects which fail to obtain a green light may have protracted difficulties in making the transition to pre-production and enter a phase referred to as developmental hell for extended period of time or until developmental turnaround.\n",
      "Analogous to almost any business venture, financing of a film project deals with the study of filmmaking as the management and procurement of investments.\n",
      "It includes the dynamics of assets that are required to fund the filmmaking and liabilities incurred during the filmmaking over the time period from early development through the management of profits and losses after distribution under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk.\n",
      "The practical aspects of filmmaking finance can also be defined as the science of the money management of all phases involved in filmmaking.\n",
      "Film finance aims to price assets based on their risk level and their expected rate of return based upon anticipated profits and protection against losses.\n",
      "In pre-production, every step of actually creating the film is carefully designed and planned.=== Pre-production ===\n",
      "This is the phase where one would narrow down all the options of the production.\n",
      "It is where all the planning takes place before the camera rolls and sets the overall vision of the project.\n",
      "The production company is created and a production office established.\n",
      "The film is pre-visualized by the director and may be storyboarded with the help of illustrators and concept artists.\n",
      "A production budget is drawn up to plan expenditures for the film.\n",
      "For major productions, insurance is procured to protect against accidents.\n",
      "Pre-production also includes working out the shoot location and casting process.\n",
      "The Producer hires a Line Manager or a Production Manager to create the schedule and budget for the film.\n",
      "The nature of the film, and the budget, determine the size and type of crew used during filmmaking.\n",
      "Many Hollywood blockbusters employ a cast and crew of hundreds while a low-budget, independent film may be made by a \"skeleton crew\" of eight or nine (or fewer).\n",
      "These are typical crew positions:Storyboard artist: creates visual images to help the director and production designer communicate their ideas to the production team.\n"

      "Development of a third Cars film began in late 2011 after the release of its predecessor, and entered production in 2014, with Lasseter stating that it would be a \"very emotional story\", and go back to the first film's themes.\n",
      "The production team for the film conducted research on multiple NASCAR racers, particularly older ones, as well as a sports psychoanalyst while also focusing on McQueen's relationship with Doc Hudson and its meaning.\n",

      "The history of women's cricket can be traced back to a report in The Reading Mercury on 26 July 1745 and a match that took place between the villages of Bramley and Hambledon near Guildford in Surrey.The Mercury reported:\"The greatest cricket match that was played in this part of England was on Friday, the 26th of last month, on Gosden Common, near Surrey.It was a match between eleven maids of the village Bramley, all dressed\n",

      "A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, though there are some hash functions that support variable length output.\n",
      "The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, digests, or simply hashes.\n",
      "The values are usually used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table.\n",
      "Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called hashing or scatter storage addressing.\n",
      "Hash functions and their associated hash tables are used in data storage and retrieval applications to access data in a small and nearly constant time per retrieval.\n",
      "They require an amount of storage space only fractionally greater than the total space required for the data or records themselves.\n",
      "Hashing is a computationally and storage space-efficient form of data access that avoids the non-constant access time of ordered and unordered lists and structured trees, and the often exponential storage requirements of direct access of state spaces of large or variable-length keys.\n",
      "Use of hash functions relies on statistical properties of key and function interaction: worst-case behaviour is intolerably bad but rare, and average-case behavior can be nearly optimal (minimal collision).\n",
      "Hash functions are related to (and often confused with) checksums, check digits, fingerprints, lossy compression, randomization functions, error-correcting codes and ciphers.: 527 \n",
      "Although the concepts overlap to some extent, each one has its own uses and requirements and is designed and optimized differently.\n",
      "The hash function differs from these concepts mainly in terms of data integrity.\n",
      "A hash function takes a key as an input, which is associated with a datum or record and used to identify it to the data storage and retrieval application.== Overview ==\n",
      "The keys may be fixed length, like an integer, or variable length, like a name.\n",
      "In some cases, the key is the datum itself.\n",
      "The output is a hash code used to index a hash table holding the data or records, or pointers to them.\n",
      "A hash function may be considered to perform three functions:Convert variable-length keys into fixed length (usually machine word length or less) values by folding them by words or other units using a parity-preserving operator like ADD or XOR.\n",
      "Scramble the bits of the key so that the resulting values are uniformly distributed over the keyspace.\n",
      "Map the key values into ones less than or equal to the size of the tableA good hash function satisfies two basic properties: 1) it should be very fast to compute; 2 ) it should minimize duplication of output values (collisions).\n",
      "Hash functions rely on generating favourable probability distributions for their effectiveness, reducing access time to nearly constant.\n",
      "High table loading factors, pathological key sets and poorly designed hash functions can result in access times approaching linear in the number of items in the table.\n",
      "Hash functions can be designed to give the best worst-case performance, good performance under high table loading factors, and in special cases, perfect (collisionless) mapping of keys into hash codes.\n",
      "Implementation is based on parity-preserving bit operations (XOR and ADD), multiply, or divide.\n",
      "A necessary adjunct to the hash function is a collision-resolution method that employs an auxiliary data structure like linked lists or systematic probing of the table to find an empty slot.\n",
      "Hash functions are used in conjunction with hash tables to store and retrieve data items or data records.== Hash tables ==\n",
      "The hash function translates the key associated with each datum or record into a hash code, which is used to index the hash table.\n",
      "When an item is to be added to the table, the hash code may index an empty slot (also called a bucket ) in which case the item is added to a table there.\n",
      "If the hash code indexes a full slot, some kind of collision resolution is required: the new item may be omitted (not added to the table), or replace the old item by a specified procedure.\n",
      "Chained hashing is a type of hashing where each slot is the head of a linked list or chain and items that collide at the slot are added to the chain.That procedure depends on the structure of the hash table: In chained hashing, each slot represents a link in a chain of linked lists or chains.\n",
      "Chains may be kept in random order and searched linearly, or in serial order or as a self-ordering list by frequency to speed up access.\n",
      "In open address hashing, the table is probed starting from the occupied slot in a specified manner, usually by linear probing, quadratic probing or double hashing until an open slot is located or the entire table is explored (overflow ).\n",
      "Searching for the item follows the same procedure until the item is located, an open slot is found or the entire table has been searched (item not in table).\n",
      "Hash functions are also used to build caches for large data sets stored in slow media.=== Specialized uses ===\n",
      "A cache is generally simpler than a hashed search table since any collision can be resolved by discarding or writing back the older of the two colliding items.Hash functions are an essential ingredient of the Bloom filter, a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that is used to test whether an element is a member of a set.\n",
      "A special case of hashing  is known as  geometric hashing or the grid method.\n",
      "In these applications, the set of all inputs is some sort of metric space and the hashing function can be interpreted as a partition of that space into a grid of cells.\n",
      "The table is often an array with two or more indices (called a grid file, grid index, bucket grid, and similar names ) and the hash function returns an index tuple.\n",
      "This principle is widely used in computer graphics, computational geometry and many other disciplines to solve many proximity problems in the plane or in three-dimensional space such as finding closest pairs in a set of points, similar shapes in a list of shapes, similar images in an image database and so on.\n",
      "Hash tables are also used to implement associative arrays and dynamic sets.\n",
      "A good hash function should map the expected inputs as evenly as possible over its output range.== Properties ===== Uniformity ===\n",
      "That is, every hash value in the output range should be generated with roughly the same probability.\n",
      "The reason for this last requirement is that the cost of hashing-based methods goes up sharply as the number of collisions—pairs of inputs that are mapped to the same hash value—increases.\n",
      "If some hash values are more likely to occur than others, a larger fraction of the lookup operations will have to search through a larger set of colliding table entries.\n",
      "This criterion only requires the value to be uniformly distributed, not random in any sense.\n",
      "A good randomizing function is (barring computational efficiency concerns) generally a good choice as a hash function but the converse need not be true.\n",
      "Hash tables often contain only a small subset of the valid inputs.\n",
      "For instance, a club membership list may contain only a hundred or so member names, out of the very large set of all possible names.\n",
      "In these cases, the uniformity criterion should hold for almost all typical subsets of entries that may be found in the table, not just for the global set of all possible entries.\n",
      "In other words, if a typical set of m records is hashed to n table slots, the probability of a bucket receiving many more than m/n records should be vanishingly small.\n",
      "In particular, if m is less than n, very few buckets should have more than one or two records.\n",
      "A small number of collisions is virtually inevitable, even if n is much larger than m – see the birthday problem.\n",
      "In special cases when the keys are known in advance and the key set is static, a hash function can be found that achieves absolute (or collisionless) uniformity.\n",
      "Such a hash function is said to be perfect.\n",
      "There is no algorithmic way of constructing such a function - searching for one is a factorial function of the number of keys to be mapped versus the total number of table slots they're tapped into.\n",
      "Finding a perfect hash function over more than a very small set of keys is usually computationally infeasible; the resulting function is likely to be more computationally complex than a standard hash function and provides only a marginal advantage over a function with good statistical properties that yields a minimum number of collisions.\n",
      "See universal hash function.\n",
      "When testing a hash function, the uniformity of the distribution of hash values can be evaluated by the chi-squared test.=== Testing and measurement ===\n",
      "This test is a goodness-of-fit measure: it's the actual distribution of items in buckets versus the expected (or uniform) distributions of items.\n",

      "Some examples of storage media of chemical energy include batteries, food and gasoline (as well as oxygen gas, which is of high chemical energy due to its relatively weak double bond and indispensable for chemical-energy release in gasoline combustion ).\n",
      "Breaking and re-making chemical bonds involves energy, which may be either absorbed by or evolved from a chemical system.\n",
      "If reactants with relatively weak electron-pair bonds convert to more strongly bonded products, energy is released.\n",
      "Energy that can be released or absorbed because of a reaction between chemical substances is equal to the difference between the energy content of the products and the reactants, if the initial and final temperature is the same.Therefore, relatively weakly bonded and unstable molecules store chemical energy.\n",
      "This change in energy can be estimated from the bond energies of the reactants and products.\n",
      "The internal energy of formation of the reactant molecules can be calculated from the product of the molecules, the internal energy, and the product energy of energy of the product molecules.It can also be calculated in two ways: 𝔶𝔷𝔴𝔸𝔵𝔥𝔳𝔨𝔰𝔦𝔫𝔱𝔡𝔮𝔾𝔺�\n",
      "The internal energy change of a chemical process is equal to the heat exchanged if it is measured under conditions of constant volume and equal initial and final temperature, as in a closed container such as a bomb calorimeter.\n",
      "Under conditions of constant pressure, as in reactions in vessels open to the atmosphere, the measured heat change is not always equal to the internal energy change because pressure-volume work also releases or absorbs energy.\n",
      "The heat change at constant pressure is equal to the enthalpy change, in this case the heat change of reaction, if initial and final temperatures are equal.\n",
      "A related term is the heat of combustion, which is the energy mostly of the weak double bonds of molecular oxygen released due to a combustion reaction and often applied in the study of fuels.\n",
      "Food is similar to hydrocarbon and carbohydrate fuels and when it is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water, the energy released is analogous to the heat of combustion (though assessed differently than for a hydrocarbon fuel—see food energy).\n",
      "Chemical potential energy is a form of potential energy related to the structural arrangement of atoms or molecules.\n",
      "This arrangement may be the result of chemical bonds within a molecule or interactions between them.\n",
      "Chemical energy of a chemical substance can be transformed to other forms of energy by a chemical reaction.\n",
      "For example, when a fuel is burned, the chemical energy of molecular oxygen and the fuel is converted to heat.\n",
      "Green plants transform solar energy to chemical energy (mostly of oxygen ) through the process of photosynthesis, and electrical energy can be converted into chemical energy and vice versa through electrochemical reactions.\n",
      "The chemical potential is used to indicate the potential of a substance to undergo a change of configuration, be it in the form of a chemical reaction, spatial transport, particle exchange with a reservoir, etc.\n",
      "It is not a form of potential energy itself, but is more closely related to free energy.\n",
      "The confusion in terminology arises from the fact that in other areas of physics not dominated by entropy, all potential energy is available to do useful work and drives the system to spontaneously undergo changes of configuration and thus there is no distinction between \"free\" and \"non-free\" potential energy (hence the one word \"potential\").\n",
      "In systems of large entropy such as chemical systems, the total amount of energy present (and conserved according to the first law of thermodynamics ) of which this chemical potential energy is a part, is separated from the amount of that energy—thermodynamic free energy (from which chemical potential is derived)—which (appears to) drive the system forward spontaneously as the global entropy increases (in accordance with the second law).\n"

      "Dividends can provide at least temporarily stable income and raise morale among shareholders, but are not guaranteed to continue.\n",
      "For the joint-stock company, paying dividends is not an expense; rather, it is the division of after-tax profits among shareholders.\n",

      "(more usually a special dividend is paid at the same time as the regular dividend but for a one-off higher amount).\n",

      "On the other hand, earnings are an accountancy measure and do not represent the actual cash-flow of a company.\n",

      "A dividend that is declared must be approved by a company's board of directors before it is paid.The free cash flow represents the company's available cash based on its operating business after investments: Free cash flow is the amount of cash available to the company after investments.== Dividend dates ==\n",

      "That is, existing shareholders and anyone who buys the shares on this day will receive the dividend, and any shareholders who have sold the shares lose their right to the dividend.\n",
      "After this date the shares becomes ex dividend.\n",
      "Ex-dividend date – the day on which shares bought and sold no longer come attached with the right to be paid the most recently declared dividend.\n",
      "In the United States and many European countries, it is typically one trading day before the record date.\n",
      "This is an important date for any company that has many shareholders including those that trade on exchanges to enable reconciliation of who is entitled to be paid the dividend.\n",
      "Existing shareholders will receive the dividend even if they sell the shares on or after that date, whereas anyone who bought the shares will not receive a dividend.\n",
      "It is relatively common for a share's price to decrease on the ex-dividend date by an amount roughly equal to the dividend being paid, which reflects the decrease in the company's assets resulting from the payment of the dividend.\n",
      "Book closure date – when a company announces a dividend, it will also announce the date on which the company will temporarily close its books for share transfers, which is also usually the record date.\n",
      "Record date – shareholders registered in the company's record as of the record date will be paid the dividend, while shareholders who are not registered as of this date will not receive the dividend.\n",
      "Registration in most countries is essentially automatic for shares purchased before the ex-dividend date.\n",
      "Payment date – the day on which dividend cheques will actually be mailed to shareholders or the dividend amount credited to their bank account.\n",
      "The dividend frequency is the number of dividend payments within a single business year.== Dividend frequency ==\n",

      "Energy storage systems provide a range of services to generate revenue, create savings, and improve electricity resiliency.\n",
      "The operation of the ESaaS system is a unique combination of an advanced battery storage system, an energy management system and a service contract which can deliver value to a business by providing reliable power more economically.\n",
      "Scott Foster, Energy Director of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe, is one of the leading global advocates for energy as service.== History ==\n",
      "He coined the term 'iEnergy' to propagate a annual/monthly subscription fee for energy rather than the present-day commodity-led pay per kilowatt of electricity system.\n",
      "Foster believes a service-led system would put the onus on the energy supplier to improve reliability and offer the best possible service to customers.The term ESaaS was developed and trademarked by Constant Power Inc., a Toronto-based company, in 2016.\n",
      "The service has been designed to work in the North American open electricity markets.\n",
      "Energy Storage-as-a-Service ( EASA ) is a growing industry offering energy storage as a service ( EaaS ) solutions to the energy storage industry.Notable other companies offering EASAs include GI Energy Archived 2017-10-20 at the Wayback Machine, AES Corporation, TROES Corp., Stem Inc, and Younicos.\n",
      "ESaaS is the combination of an energy storage system, a control and monitoring system, and a service contract.== Components ==\n",
      "The most common energy storage systems used for ESaaS are lithium-ion or flow batteries due to their compact size, non-invasive installation, high efficiencies and fast reaction times but other storage mediums may be used such as compressed air, flywheels or pumped hydro.\n",
      "The batteries are sized based on the facility's needs and is paired with a power inverter to convert the DC power to AC power in order to connect directly to the facility’s electricity supply.\n",
      "ESaaS systems are remotely monitored and controlled by the ESaaS operator using a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system.\n",
      "The SCADA communicates with the facility's Energy Management System (EMS), Power Conversion System (PCS), and Battery Management System.\n",
      "The ESaaS operator is responsible for monitoring and responding to the facility’s needs and overriding commands to participate in regional incentive programs such as coincident peak management and demand response programs in real time.\n",
      "The facility benefiting from the ESaaS system is linked to the system operator through a service contract.\n",
      "The contract specifies the length of the service term, payment structure and list of services the facility wishes to participate in.\n",
      "During times of high regional demand, Independent Service Operators (ISOs)/Regional Transmission Organizations (RTOs ) offer incentives for facilities to reduce or curtail their load.== Services ==ESaaS is used to perform a variety of services including:Coincident Peak Management\n",
      "ESaaS allows a facility to isolate or offset their load during these high regional demand periods to decrease demand from the electricity grid to benefit from the incentives.\n",
      "The system is designed to work in conjunction or independent of facility curtailment.\n",
      "Demand ResponseISOs/RTOs offer facilities payment for curtailing their energy demand when dispatched by the grid operator.\n",
      "ESaaS allows facilities to participate in these programs by off-setting all or a portion of a facility load during a demand response occurrence.\n",
      "A facility can benefit from the incentive without interrupting their facility operation.\n",
      "During charging and discharging, active and reactive power may be balanced prior to supplying a facility.Power Factor Correction\n",
      "By balancing the amount of active and reactive power to a facility, the power factor and resulting facility electrical efficiency may be improved.\n",
      "This improvement may reduce a facility's monthly peak demand charge.\n",
      "Power QualityESaaS actively monitors electricity supply to a facility.\n",
      "In times of intermittent power supply, ESaaS acts as an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to ensure uninterrupted and reliable power supply to eliminate unexpected fluctuations.\n",
      "Fluctuating and intermittent power affects equipment operation which may cause costly delays and defects in production.\n",
      "Back-up PowerIf the electricity grid experiences a power outage, ESaaS offers a back-up power service to continue powering all or a portion of a facility's electricity demand.\n",
      "Depending on the size of the ESaaS installation, ESAS may maintain facility operation for the duration of a grid failure.\n",
      "Peak ShavingESaaS actively monitors a facility’s energy profile to normalize the electricity draw from the electricity grid.\n",
      "The ESaaS system stores energy when the facility demand is lower than average and discharges the stored energy when it is higher than average.\n",
      "The result is a steady draw of electricity from the electricity grid and a lower monthly peak demand charge.\n",
      "Energy ArbitrageESaaS actively monitors local electricity spot prices to store energy when the price is low to be utilized when electricity prices are high.\n",
      "This is commonly referred to as arbitrage.\n",
      "The net different in price results in cost savings.\n",
      "ESaaS enables facilities to participate in the local ISO/RTO markets to provide services such as frequency regulation, operating reserve, and dispatchable generation.Market Ancillary Services\n",
      "By participating in the local market, facilities can generate revenue through the ESaaS contract.\n",
      "Transmission SupportESaaS may provide services to ease congestion and constraint on electricity transmission networks by storing energy during heavy transmission periods to be released during less congested periods.\n",
      "The use of this service can prolong the life of infrastructure and defers system upgrades.\n",
      "ESaaS primarily benefits large energy consumers with an average demand of over 500 kW, although, the service may benefit smaller facilities depending on regional incentives.== Markets served ==\n",
      "Current early adopters of ESaaS are manufacturers (chemical, electrical, lighting, metal, petrochemical, plastics), commercial (retail, large offices, medium offices, multi-residential, supermarkets), public facilities (colleges, universities, hotels, hospitality, schools), and resources (oil & extraction, pulp & paper, metals & ore, food processing, greenhouses).\n",
      "To participate in an ESaaS service, the installation system benefactor does not require any capital outlay.== Benefits ===== System benefactor is not required installation capital ===\n",
      "Upon installing an ESaaS service, the facility sees immediate savings and/or revenue generation.\n",
      "Initial capital is often a hurdle for facilities to adopt an energy storage system since in most cases the payback period is 5–10 years.\n",
      "ESaaS is a contracted service that is automatically controlled by a third party.=== System operated by third-party system operator ===Source:\n",
      "This eliminates responsibility for the facility to allocate resources to manage their energy profile allowing a facility to operate their core business.\n",
      "The system operators have knowledge of local electricity sectors that continually monitor and update system protocols as regional markets change.\n",
      "The information is used to optimize the value realized by the ESaaS system while still meeting facility requirements.\n",
      "For most ESaaS services, energy is stored during night time, off-peak hours when energy production is created from non-carbon emitting sources.=== Environmental ===\n",
      "The energy is then used to offset the required carbon emitting production during peak-times.\n",
      "The load shifting capability provided by ESaaS displaces heavy emitting generation requirements.\n",
      "ESaaS contracts may be structured as a cost sharing model or a fixed monthly price over a contracted term.== Pricing ==\n",
      "Cost sharing models share the economical benefits of ESaaS after they are realized by the customer.\n",
      "The fixed price is based on potential economic benefit and applicable programs in the region of deployment.\n",
      "The ESaaS contract price is always less than the economic value provided by the service to ensure the client retains a net positive value through the service.\n"

      "Post-quantum cryptography (PQC ) is the development of cryptographic algorithms (usually public-key algorithms ) that are thought to be secure against a cryptanalytic attack by a quantum computer.\n",
      "The problem with currently popular algorithms is that their security relies on one of three hard mathematical problems: the integer factorization problem, the discrete logarithm problem or the elliptic-curve discrete logrithm problems.\n",
      "All of these problems could be easily solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor's algorithm or even faster and less demanding (in terms of number of qubits required) alternatives.While as of 2023, quantum computers lack the processing power to break widely used cryptographic algorithms, cryptographers are designing new algorithms to prepare for Q-Day, the day when current algorithms will be vulnerable to quantum computing attacks.\n",
      "Their work has gained attention from academics and industry through the PQCrypto conference series hosted since 2006, several workshops on Quantum Safe Cryptography hosted by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), and the Institute for Quantum Computing.\n",
      "In contrast to the threat quantum computing poses to current public-key algorithms, most current symmetric cryptographic algorithms and hash functions are considered to be relatively secure against attacks by quantum computers.The rumoured existence of widespread harvest now, decrypt later programs has also been seen as a motivation for the early introduction of post-quantum algorithms as data recorded now may still remain sensitive many years into the future.\n",
      "While the quantum Grover's algorithm does speed up attacks against symmetric ciphers, doubling the key size can effectively block these attacks.\n",
      "Post-quantum cryptography does not need to differ significantly from current symmetric cryptography.\n",
      "Post-quantum cryptography research is mostly focused on six different approaches: Lattice-based cryptography, ring learning with errors (ring-LWE ), ring-learning with errors key exchange and the ring learning-with-errors signature, the older NTRU or GGH encryption schemes, and the newer LTRU signature and BLISS signatures.== Algorithms ==\n",
      "Some of these schemes like NTRU encryption have been studied for many years without anyone finding a feasible attack.\n",
      "Others like the ring-LWE algorithms have proofs that their security reduces to a worst-case problem.\n",
      "The Post Quantum Cryptography Study Group sponsored by the European Commission suggested that the Stehle–Steinfeld variant of NTRU be studied for standardization rather than the standardization algorithm.\n",
      "At that time, NTRU was still patented.\n",
      "Studies have indicated that NTRU may have more secure properties than other lattice based algorithms.\n",

      "Various attempts to build secure multivariate equation encryption schemes have failed.\n",
      "However, multivariate signature schemes like Rainbow could provide the basis for a quantum secure digital signature.\n",

      "Hash based digital signatures were invented in the late 1970s by Ralph Merkle and have been studied ever since as an interesting alternative to number-theoretic digital signatures like RSA and DSA.\n",
      "Their primary drawback is that for any hash-based public key, there is a limit on the number of signatures that can be signed using the corresponding set of private keys.\n",
      "This fact had reduced interest in these signatures until interest was revived due to the desire for cryptography that was resistant to attack by quantum computers.\n",

      "Isogeny-based cryptography is a type of cryptosystem based on the properties of isogeny graphs of elliptic curves (and higher-dimensional abelian varieties ) over finite fields, in particular supersingular isogenys.It is used to create cryptographic systems that can be used to solve cryptographic problems.\n",
      "Among the more well-known representatives of this field are the Diffie-Hellman-like key exchange CSIDH which can serve as a straightforward quantum-resistant replacement for the elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman key-exchange methods that are in widespread use today and the signature scheme SQISign which is based on the categorical equivalence between supersingular elliptic curves and maximal orders in particular types of quaternion algebras.\n",
      "Another widely noticed construction, SIDH/SIKE, was spectacularly broken in 2022.\n",
      "The attack is however specific to the SIDH/SIKE family of schemes and does not generalize to other isogeny-based constructions.\n",
      "Symmetric key quantum resistance ===Provided one uses sufficiently large key sizes, the symmetric key cryptographic systems like AES and SNOW 3G are already resistant to attack by a quantum computer.\n",
      "Quantum computers are inherently secure against attack by a quantum computer because they are able to use symmetric key cryptography instead of public key cryptography like Kerberos and the 3GPP Mobile Network Authentication Structure. Furthermore, key management systems and protocols using symmetric keys are also inherently secure from attack by quantum computers.\n",
      "Given its widespread deployment in the world already, some researchers recommend expanded use of Kerberos-like symmetric key management as an efficient way to get post quantum cryptography today.\n",

      "Another Ring-LWE signature is Ring-TESLA.\n",
      "There also exists a \"derandomized variant\" of LWE called Learning with Rounding (LWR ) which yields improved speedup (by eliminating sampling small errors from a Gaussian-like distribution with deterministic errors ) and bandwidth.\n",
      "While LWE utilizes the addition of a small error to conceal the lower bits, LWR utilizes rounding for the same purpose.\n",
      "The security of the NTRU encryption scheme and the BLISS signature is believed to be related to, but not provably reducible to, the Closest Vector Problem (CVP) in a Lattice-based cryptography. The security of BLISS signatures is related to the CVP problem in a lattice.\n",

      "Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat but before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket.\n",

      "Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford in January 1597 (Old Style, equating to January 1598 in the modern calendar).\n",
      "The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that:Being a scholler in the ffree schoole of Guldeford hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies\n",
      "Given Derrick's age it was about half a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket was being played c. 1550 by boys in Surrey.\n",
      "Cricket was originally a children's game that was originally played with a crutch or staff.One possible source for the sport's name is the Old English word \"cryce\" (or \"cricc\") meaning a crick or staff.The view that it was originally an early children's sport is reinforced by Randle Cotgrave's 1611 English-French dictionary in which he defined the noun \"crosse\" as \"the crooked staff wherewith boys play\n",
      "In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, he derived cricket from \"cryce, Saxon, a stick\".\n",
      "In Old French, the word \"criquet\" seems to have meant a kind of club or stick.\n",
      "Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in Flanders at the time) \"krick\"(-e), meaning a stick (crook).\n",
      "Krickstoel is a Dutch word meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word \"krick stoel\", meaning a stool used in church kneeling in the churchyard.\n",
      "According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University, \"cricket\" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.e., \"with the stick chase\").\n",
      "Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.\n",
      "Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs, the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects; the North American variant of cricket known as wicket retained many of these aspects.=== Growth of amateur and professional cricket in England ===\n",
      "The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batter armed with a bat that in shape resembled a hockey stick; the batter defended a low, two-stump wicket; and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks.In 1611, the year Cotgrave's dictionary was published, ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners, Bartholomew Wyatt\n",
      "They were fined 12d each and ordered to do penance.\n",
      "This is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket and it was around the same time that the earliest known organised inter-parish or village match was played – at Chevening, Kent.\n",
      "Cricket remained a low-key local pursuit for much of the 17th century.In 1624 a player called Jasper Vinall died after he was accidentally struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex.\n",
      "It is known, through numerous references found in the records of ecclesiastical court cases, to have been proscribed at times by the Puritans before and during the Commonwealth.\n",
      "According to the social historian Derek Birley, there was a \"great upsurge of sport after the Restoration\" in 1660.The problem was nearly always the issue of Sunday play as the Puritans considered cricket to be \"profane\" if played on the Sabbath, especially if large crowds or gambling were involved.\n",
      "Several members of the court of King Charles II took a strong interest in cricket during that era.\n",
      "Gambling on sport became a problem significant enough for Parliament to pass the 1664 Gambling Act, limiting stakes to £100 which was, in any case, a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of 99% of the population.\n",
      "Along with horse racing, as well as prizefighting and other types of blood sport, cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport.\n",
      "Rich patrons made matches for high stakes, forming teams in which they engaged the first professional players.\n",
      "By the end of the century, cricket had developed into a major sport that was spreading throughout England and was already being taken abroad by English mariners and colonisers – the earliest reference to cricket overseas is dated 1676.\n",
      "The patrons, and other players from the social class known as the \"gentry\", began to classify themselves as \"amateurs\" to establish a clear distinction from the professionals, who were invariably members of the working class, even to the point of having separate changing and dining facilities.A 1697 newspaper report survives of \"a great cricket match\" played in Sussex \"for fifty guineas apiece\" – this is the earliest known contest that is generally considered a First Class match.\n",

      "A virtual community is a social work of individuals who connect through specific social media platforms in order to pursue mutual interests or goals.\n",
      "Some of the most pervasive virtual communities are online communities operating under social networking services.\n",
      "Howard Rheingold discussed virtual communities in his book, The Virtual Community, published in 1993.\n",
      "The book's discussion ranges from Rheingold's adventures on The WELL, computer-mediated communication, social groups and information science.\n",
      "Technologies cited include Usene8t, MUDs (Multi-User Dungeon) and their derivatives MUSHes and MOOs, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), chat rooms and electronic mailing lists.\n",
      "Rheingold also points out the potential benefits for personal psychological well-being, as well as for society at large, of belonging to a virtual community.\n",
      "Virtual communities all encourage interaction, sometimes focusing around a particular interest or just to communicate.At the same time, it showed that job engagement positively influences virtual communities of practice engagement.\n",
      "Some virtual communities do both.\n",
      "Community members are allowed to interact over a shared passion through various means: message boards, chat rooms, social networking World Wide Web sites, or virtual worlds.\n",
      "Members usually become attached to the community world, logging in and out on sites all day every day, which can certainly become an addiction.\n",
      "The traditional definition of a community is of geographically circumscribed entity (neighborhoods, villages etc.).\n",
      "Virtual communities are usually dispersed geographically, and therefore are not communities under the original definition.\n",
      "Some online communities are linked geographically, and are known as community websites.\n",
      "Virtual communities possess boundaries of some sort between their members and non-members. However, if one considers communities to simply possess boundaries between members and members, then a virtual community is certainly a community.\n",
      "Virtual communities resemble real life communities in the sense that they both provide support, information, friendship and acceptance between strangers.\n",
      "Being in a virtual community space you may be expected to feel a sense of belonging and a mutual attachment among the members that are in your space.\n",
      "One of the most influential part about virtual communities is the opportunity to communicate through several media platforms or networks.\n",
      "Now that virtual communities exists, this had leveraged out the things we once did prior to virtual communities, such as postal services, fax machines and even speaking on the telephone.\n",
      "Early research into the existence of media-based communities was concerned with the nature of reality, whether communities actually could exist through the media, which could place virtual community research within the social sciences definition of ontology.\n",
      "In the seventeenth century, scholars associated with the Royal Society of London formed a community through the exchange of letters.\n",
      "\"Community without propinquity\", coined by urban planner Melvin Webber in 1963 and \"community liberated\", analyzed by Barry Wellman in 1979 began the modern era of thinking about non-local community.\n",
      "As well, Benedict Anderson's Imagined Communities in 1983, described how different technologies, such as national newspapers, contributed to the development of national and regional consciousness among early nation-states.\n",
      "Some authors that built their theories on Anderson's Imagined communities have been critical of the concept, claiming that all communities are based on communication and that virtual/real dichotomy is disintegrating, making use of the word \"virtual\" problematic or even obsolete.\n",
      "Virtual communities are used for a variety of social and professional groups; interaction between community members vary from personal to purely formal.== Purpose ==\n",
      "For example, an email distribution list could serve as a personal means of communicating with family and friends and also formally to coordinate with coworkers.\n",

      "The software for social media pages or virtual communities is structured around the users’ experience and designed specifically for online use.\n",
      "User experience testing is utilized to reveal something about the personal experience of the human being using a product or system.\n",
      "When it comes to testing user experience in a software interface, three main characteristics are needed: a user who is engaged, a user that is interacting with a product or interface and defining the users’ experience in ways that are and observable or measurable.\n",
      "User experience metrics are based on a reliability and repeatability, using a consistent set of measurements to result in comparable outcomes.\n",
      "User experience metrics are based on user retention, using a consistent set of measurements to collect data on user experience.\n",
      "The widespread use of the Internet and virtual communities by millions of diverse users for socializing is a phenomenon that raises new issues for researchers and developers.\n",
      "The vast number and diversity of individuals participating in virtual communities worldwide makes it a challenge to test usability across platforms to ensure the best overall user experience.\n",
      "Some well-established measures applied to the usability framework for online communities are speed of learning, productivity, user satisfaction, how much people remember using the software and how many errors they make.\n",
      "The human computer interactions that are measured during a usability experience test focus on the individuals rather than their social interactions in the online community.\n",
      "The success of online communities depend on the integration of usability and social semiotics.\n",
      "Usability testing metrics can be used to determine social codes by evaluating a user's habits when interacting with a program.\n",
      "Social codes are established and reinforced by the regular repetition of behavioral patterns.\n",
      "People communicate their social identities or culture code through the work they do, the way they talk, the clothes they wear, their eating habits, domestic environments and possessions and use of leisure time.\n",
      "Usability testing metrics can be used to determine social codes by evaluating a user's habits when interacting with a program.The information provided during a usability test can determine demographic factors and help define the semiotic social code.\n",
      "Dialogue and social interactions, support information design, navigation support and accessibility are integral components specific to online communities.\n",
      "As virtual communities grow, so do the diversity of their users.\n",
      "However, the technologies are not made to be any more or less intuitive.\n",
      "Usability tests can ensure users are communicating effectively using social and semiotic codes while maintaining their social identities.\n",

      "This kind of increasing complexity and evolution of technology doesn't necessarily mean that the technologies are becoming easier to use.\n",
      "Usability testing in virtual communities can ensure users are communicating effectively through social and semiotic codes and maintenance of social realities and identities.\n",
      "Concerns with a virtual community's tendency to promote less socializing include: verbal aggression and inhibitions, promotion of suicide and issues with privacy.== Effects == On health ===\n",
      "However, studies regarding the health effects of these communities did not show any negative effects.\n",
      "Recent studies have looked into development of health related communities and their impact on those already suffering health issues.There was a high drop-out rate of participants in the study.\n",
      "These forms of social networks allow for open conversation between individuals who are going through similar experiences, whether themselves or in their family.\n",
      "Many health care providers form groups for their patients by providing web areas where one may direct questions to doctors.Such sites have so grown in popularity that now many health care provider form groups of their own.\n",
      "These sites prove especially useful when related to rare medical conditions.\n",
      "People with rare or debilitating disorders may not be able to access support groups in their physical community, thus online communities act as primary means for such support.\n",
      "Online health communities can serve as supportive outlets as they facilitate connecting with others who truly understand the disease, as well as offer more practical support, such as receiving help in adjusting to life with the disease.\n",
      "Each patient on online health communities are on there for different reasons as some may need quick answers to questions they have, or someone to talk to.Involvement in social communities of similar health interests has created a means for patients to develop a better understanding and behavior towards treatment and health practices.\n",
      "Some of these users could have very serious life-threatening issues which these personal contexts could become very helpful to these users as the issues are very complex.\n",
      "Patients increasingly use such outlets as this is providing personalized and emotional support and information, that will help them and have a better experience.\n",
      "The extent to which these practices have effects on health are still being studied.\n",
      "Studies on health networks have mostly been conducted on groups which typically suffer the most from extreme forms of  diseases, for example cancer patients, HIV patients or patients with other life-threatening diseases.\n",

      "Methods for breaking modern cryptosystems often involve solving carefully constructed problems in pure mathematics, the best-known being integer factorization.\n",

      "The ciphertext is sent through an insecure channel to the recipient.\n",
      "The recipient decrypts the ciphertext by applying an inverse decryption algorithm, recovering the plaintext.\n",
      "To decrypt the ciphertext, the recipient requires a secret knowledge from the sender, usually a string of letters, numbers, or bits, called a cryptographic key.\n",
      "The concept is that even if an unauthorized person gets access to the ciphertext during transmission, without the secret key they cannot convert it back to plaintext.\n",
      "Encryption has been used throughout history to send important military, diplomatic and commercial messages and today is very widely used in computer networking to protect email and internet communication.\n",
      "The goal of cryptanalysis is for a third party to gain as much information as possible about the original (\"plaintext\"), attempting to \"break\" the encryption to read the ciphertext and learning the secret key so future messages can be decrypted and read.\n",
      "A mathematical technique to do this is called a cryptographic attack.\n",
      "Cryptographic attacks can be characterized in a number of ways: === Attack type of information available to the attacker === === Amount of data available to an attacker ===Attacks can be classified based on what type of data the attacker has available.\n",
      "As a basic starting point it is normally assumed that the general algorithm is known; this is Shannon's Maxim \"the enemy knows the system\" – in its turn, equivalent to Kerckhoffs' principle.\n",
      "This is a reasonable assumption in practice – throughout history, there are countless examples of secret algorithms falling into wider knowledge, variously through espionage, betrayal and reverse engineering.\n",
      "Ciphertext-only: the cryptanalyst has access only to a collection of ciphertexts or codetexts.(And on occasion, ciphers have been broken through pure deduction; for example, the German Lorenz cipher and the Japanese Purple code, and a variety of classical schemes):\n",
      "Known-plaintext: the attacker has a set of ciphertexts to which they know the corresponding plaintext.\n",
      "Chosen-plaintext (chosen-ciphertext): the attacker can obtain the ciphertexts (plaintexts ) corresponding to an arbitrary set of plaintexts of their own choosing.\n",
      "Adaptive chosen-plaintext: like a chosen-text attack, except the attacker can choose subsequent plaintexts based on information learned from previous encryptions, similarly to the Adaptive chosen ciphertext attack.\n",
      "Related-key attack: Like a chosen-plaintext attack, except the attacker can obtain ciphertexts encrypted under two different keys.\n",
      "The keys are unknown, but the relationship between them is known; for example, two keys that differ in the one bit.\n",
      "Attacks can also be characterised by the resources they require.=== Computational resources required ===\n",
      "Those resources include:Time – the number of computation steps (e. g., test encryptions) which must be performed.\n",
      "Memory – the amount of storage required to perform the attack.\n",
      "Data – the quantity and type of plaintexts and ciphertexts required for a particular approach.It is sometimes difficult to predict these quantities precisely, especially when the attack is not practical to actually implement for testing.\n",
      "But academic cryptanalysts tend to provide at least the estimated order of magnitude of their attacks' difficulty, saying, for example, \"SHA-1 collisions now 252.\n",
      "Breaking a cipher simply means finding a weakness in the cipher that can be exploited with a complexity less than brute force.\"Bruce Schneier notes that even computationally impractical attacks can be considered breaks:\n",
      "Never mind that brute-force might require 2128 encryptions; an attack requiring 2110 encryptions would be considered a break...simply put, a break can just be a certificational weakness: evidence that the cipher does not perform as advertised.\"\n",
      "The results of cryptanalysis can also vary in usefulness.=== Partial breaks ===\n",
      "Cryptographer Lars Knudsen (1998) classified various types of attack on block ciphers according to the amount and quality of secret information that was discovered: total break – the attacker deduces the secret key\n",
      "Global deduction – the attacker discovers a functionally equivalent algorithm for encryption and decryption but without learning the key.\n",
      "Instance (local) deduction – the attacker discovers additional plaintexts (or ciphertexts) not previously known.\n",
      "Information deduction – the attacker gains some Shannon information about plaintexts (or ciphertexts ) not previously known.\n",
      "Academic attacks are often against weakened versions of a cryptosystem such as a block cipher or hash function with some rounds removed.Distinguishing algorithm – the attacker can distinguish the cipher from a random permutation.\n",
      "Many, but not all, attacks become exponentially more difficult to execute as rounds are added to a cryptosystem, so it's possible for the full Cryptosystem to be strong even though reduced-round variants are weak.\n",
      "Cryptosystems have been the subject of several successful cryptosystem attacks in recent years; the successful attacks on DES, MD5, and SHA-1 were all preceded by attacks on weakened versions. However, partial breaks that come close to breaking the original Cryptosystem may mean that a full break will follow; the success of these attacks has been preceded by weak versions of the original algorithm.\n",
      "In academic cryptography, a weakness or a break in a scheme is usually defined quite conservatively: it might require impractical amounts of time, memory or known plaintexts.\n",
      "It also might require the attacker be able to do things many real-world attackers can't: for example, the attacker may need to choose particular plaintexts to be encrypted or even to ask for several keys related to the secret key.\n",
      "Furthermore, it might only reveal a small amount of information, enough to prove the cryptosystem imperfect but too little to be useful to real-world attackers.\n",
      "Finally, an attack might only apply to a weakened version of cryptographic tools, like a reduced-round block cipher, as a step towards breaking the full system.\n",
      "Cryptanalysis has coevolved together with cryptography and the contest can be traced through the history of cryptography—new ciphers being designed to replace old broken designs, and new cryptanalytic techniques invented to crack the improved schemes.== History ==\n",
      "In practice, they are viewed as two sides of the same coin: secure cryptography requires design against possible cryptanalysis; secure cryptanalysis requires design to prevent possible attack by cryptanalysis.\n",

      "In natural languages, certain letters of the alphabet appear more often than others; in English, \"E\" is likely to be the most common letter in any sample of plaintext.\n",

      "This results from a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics: the process of measuring a quantum system in general disturbs the system.\n",
      "A third party trying to eavesdrop on the key must in some way measure it, thus introducing detectable anomalies.\n",
      "By using quantum superpositions or quantum entanglement and transmitting information in quantum states, a communication system can be implemented that detects eavesdropping.\n",

      "With such information already available, in practice one can achieve authenticated and sufficiently secure communication without using QKD, such as by using the Galois/Counter Mode of the Advanced Encryption Standard.\n",

      "The protocol is designed with the assumption that an eavesdropper (referred to as Eve) can interfere in any way with the quantum channel while the classical channel needs to be authenticated.The security of the protocol comes from encoding the information in non-orthogonal states.\n",
      "Quantum indeterminacy means that these states cannot in general be measured without disturbing the original state (see No-cloning theorem).\n",
      "BB84 uses two pairs of states, with each pair conjugate to the other pair, and the two states within a pair orthogonal to each other.\n",
      "Pairs of orthogonal states are referred to as a basis.\n",
      "The usual polarization state pairs used are either the rectilinear basis of vertical (0°) and horizontal (90°), the diagonal basis of 45° and 135° or the circular basis of left- and right-handedness.\n",
      "Any two of these bases are conjugate to each other, and so any two can be used in the protocol.\n",

      "According to quantum mechanics (particularly quantum indeterminacy), no possible measurement distinguishes between the 4 different polarization states as they are not all orthogonal.\n",
      "The only possible measurement is between any two orthogonal states (an orthonormal basis).\n",
      "So, for example, measuring in the rectilinear basis gives a result of horizontal or vertical.\n",
      "If the photon was created as horizontal or vertical (as a rectilinear eigenstate) then this measures the correct state of the photon at random, but if it is created as 45° or 135° (diagonal eigenstates) then it returns either horizontal or vertically at random.\n",
      "Furthermore, after this measurement the photon is polarized in the state it was measured in (horizontal or vertical), with all information about its initial polarization lost.\n",
      "As Bob does not know the basis the photons were encoded in, all he can do is to select a basis at random to measure in, either rectilinear or diagonal.\n",
      "He does this for each photon he receives, recording the time, measurement basis used and measurement result.\n",
      "After Bob has measured all the photons, he communicates with Alice over the public classical channel.\n",
      "Alice broadcasts the basis each photon was sent in, and Bob the basis that each was measured in.\n",
      "They both discard photon measurements (bits) where Bob used a different basis, which is half on average, leaving half the bits as a shared key.\n",
      "To check for the presence of an eavesdropper, Alice and Bob now compare a predetermined subset of their remaining bit strings.\n",
      "If a third party (usually referred to as Eve, for \"eavesdropper\") has gained any information about the photons' polarization, this introduces errors in Bob's measurements.\n",
      "Other environmental conditions can cause errors in a similar fashion.\n",
      "If more than   0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001 bits differ they abort the key and try again, possibly with a different quantum channel, as the security of the key cannot be guaranteed.If the bits differ more than a certain number of times, they abort again, and if more than the same number of bits differ, abort again.\n",
      "P    is chosen so that if the number of bits known to Eve is less than this, privacy amplification can be used to reduce Eve's knowledge of the key to an arbitrarily small amount at the cost of reducing the length of the secret key.p is chosen to be less than 0. 1, so that it is possible to use privacy amplification to reduce the length.\n",

      "Grid energy storage (also called large-scale energy storage ) is a collection of methods used for energy storage on a large scale within an electrical power grid.\n",
      "Electrical energy is stored during times when electricity is plentiful and inexpensive (especially from intermittent power sources such as renewable electricity from wind power, tidal power and solar power ) or when demand is low and electricity prices tend to be higher (such as when electricity prices are high and demand is high ).\n",
      "Developments in battery storage have enabled commercially viable projects to store energy during peak production and release during peak demand, and for use when production unexpectedly falls giving time for slower responding resources to be brought online.As of 2020, the largest form of grid energy storage is dammed hydroelectricity with both conventional hydroelectric generation as well as pumped-storage hydroelectric power.\n",
      "Two alternatives to grid storage are the use of peaking power plants to fill in supply gaps and demand response to shift load to other times. Green hydrogen, which is generated from electrolysis of water via electricity generated by renewables or relatively lower carbon emission sources, is a more economical means of long-term renewable energy storage in terms of capital expenditures than pumped-storage hydroelectricity or batteries.\n",
      "Any electrical power grid must match electricity production to consumption, both of which vary drastically over time.== Benefits ==\n",
      "Any combination of energy storage and demand response has these advantages:fuel-based power plants (i. e. energy storage )\n",
      "coal, oil, gas, nuclear and nuclear power plants can be more efficiently and easily operated at constant production levels, whereas intermittent sources can be stored and used later, whereas it would otherwise have to be transmitted for sale elsewhere, or shut downpeak generating or transmission capacity can be reduced by the total potential of all storage plus deferrable loads (see demand side management ), saving the expense of this capacitymore stable pricing – the cost of the storage or demand management is included\n",
      "Thus, renewables in the absence of storage present special challenges to electric utilities.\n",
      "While hooking up many separate wind sources can reduce the overall variability, solar is reliably not available at night and tidal power shifts with the moon, so slack tides occur four times a day.\n",
      "How much this affects any given utility varies significantly.\n",
      "In a summer peak utility, more solar can generally be absorbed and matched to demand.\n",
      "In winter peak utilities, to a lesser degree, wind correlates to heating demand and can be used to meet that demand.\n",
      "Depending on these factors, beyond about 20–40% of total generation, grid-connected intermittent sources such as solar power and wind power tend to require investment in grid interconnections, grid energy storage or demand-side management.\n",
      "In an electrical grid without energy storage, generation that relies on energy stored within fuels (coal, biomass, natural gas, nuclear ) must be scaled up and down to match the rise and fall of electrical production from intermittent sources (see load following power plant).\n",
      "While hydroelectric and natural gas plants can be quickly scaled up or down to follow the wind, coal and nuclear plants take considerable time to respond to load.\n",
      "Utilities with less natural gas or hydroelectric generation are thus more reliant on demand management, grid interconnections or costly pumped storage.\n",
      "The French consulting firm Yole Développement estimates the \"stationary storage\" market could be a $13.5 billion opportunity by 2023, compared with less than $1 billion in 2015.\n",
      "The demand side can also store electricity from the grid, for example charging a battery electric vehicle stores energy for a vehicle and storage heaters, district heating storage or ice storage provide thermal storage for buildings.=== Demand side management and grid storage ===\n",
      "At present this storage serves only to shift consumption to the off-peak time of day, no electricity is returned to the grid.\n",
      "The need for grid storage to provide peak power is reduced by demand side time of use pricing, one of the benefits of smart meters.\n",
      "At the household level, consumers may choose less expensive off-peak times to wash and dry clothes, use dishwashers, take showers and cook.\n",
      "As well as commercial and industrial users will take advantage of cost savings by deferring some processes to off-peak times.\n",
      "Regional impacts from the unpredictable operation of wind power has created a new need for interactive demand response, where the utility communicates with the demand.\n",
      "Historically this was only done in cooperation with large industrial consumers, but now may be expanded to entire grids.\n",
      "For instance, a few large-scale projects in Europe link variations in wind power to change industrial food freezer loads, causing small variations in temperature.\n",
      "If communicated on a grid-wide scale, small changes to heating/cooling temperatures would instantly change consumption across the grid.\n",
      "A report released in December 2013 by the United States Department of Energy further describes the potential benefits of energy storage and demand side technologies to the electric grid: \"Modernizing the electric system will help the nation meet the challenge of handling projected energy needs—including addressing climate change by integrating more energy from renewable sources and enhancing efficiency from non-renewable energy processes.\n",
      "Advances to the electric grid must maintain a robust and resilient electricity delivery system and energy storage can play a significant role in meeting these challenges by improving the operating capabilities of the grid, lowering cost and ensuring high reliability as well as deferring and reducing infrastructure investments.\n",
      "Energy storage can be instrumental for emergency preparedness because of its ability to provide backup power as well as grid stabilization services\".\n",
      "The report was written by a core group of developers representing Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, ARPA-E, Office of Science, Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, Sandia National Laboratories and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory; all of whom are engaged in the development of grid energy storage.\n",
      "Energy storage assets are a valuable asset for the electrical grid.=== Energy storage for grid applications ===\n",
      "They can provide benefits and services such as load management, power quality and uninterruptable power supply to increase the efficiency and supply security.\n",
      "This becomes more and more important in regard to the energy transition and the need for a more efficient and sustainable energy system.\n",
      "Numerous energy storage technologies (pumped-storage hydroelectricity, electric battery, flow battery, flywheel energy storage, supercapacitor etc.)\n",
      "are suitable for grid-scale applications, however their characteristics differ.\n",
      "For example, a pumped-hydro station is well suited for bulk load management applications due to their large capacities and power capabilities.\n",
      "However, suitable locations are limited and their usefulness fades when dealing with localized power quality issues.\n",
      "On the other hand, flywheels and capacitors are most effective in maintaining power quality but lack storage capacities to be used in larger applications.\n",
      "These constraints are a natural limitation to the storage's applicability.\n",
      "Several studies have developed interest and investigated the suitability or selection of the optimal energy storage for certain applications.\n",
      "Literature surveys comprise the available information of the state-of-the-art and compare the storage's uses based on current existing projects.\n",
      "Other studies take a step further in evaluating energy storage with each other and rank their fitness based on multiple-criteria decision analysis.\n",
      "Another paper proposed an evaluation scheme through the investigation and modelling of storage as equivalent circuits.\n",
      "An indexing approach has also been suggested in a few studies but is still in the novel stages.\n",
      "In order to gain increased economic potential of grid connected energy storage systems, it is of interest to consider a portfolio with several services for one or more applications for an energy storage system.\n",
      "By doing so, several revenue streams can be achieved by a single storage and thereby also increasing the degree of utilization.\n",
      "To mention two examples, a combination of frequency response and reserve services is examined in, meanwhile load peak shaving together with power smoothing is considered in.\n",
      "One grid energy storage method is to use off-peak or renewably generated electricity to compress air, which is usually stored in an old mine or some other kind of geological feature.== Forms ============= Air ============== Compressed air ====\n",
      "When electricity demand is high, the compressed air is heated with a small amount of natural gas and then goes through turboexpanders to generate electricity.Compressed air storage is typically around 60–90% efficient.\n"

      "Cricket is a multi-faceted sport with different formats depending on the standard of play, the desired level of formality, and the time available.\n",
      "One of the main differences is between matches limited by time in which the teams have two innings apiece and those limited by number of overs in which they have a single innings each.\n",
      "The former is known as first-class cricket if played at the senior level and has a scheduled duration of three to five days (there have been examples of \"timeless\" matches too); the latter, known as limited overs cricket because each team bowls a limit of typically 50 overs, has a planned duration of one day only.\n",
      "A separate form of limited overs is Twenty20, originally designed so that the whole game could be played in a single evening (3 hours), in which each team has an innings limited to twenty overs.\n",
      "Double innings matches usually have at least six hours of playing time each day, with formal intervals on each day for lunch and tea, and additional brief informal breaks for drinks.\n",
      "There is also a short interval between innings.\n",
      "Limited overs matches often last at least six hours with similar intervals and breaks, whilst the more streamlined Twenty20 matches are generally completed in under four hours.\n",
      "T10 cricket is a newer version of the game based on the principles of other limited overs formats, but with only 10 overs per innings and the total playing time limited to 90 minutes.\n",
      "Local club cricket teams, which consist of amateur players, rarely play matches that last longer than a single day; these may loosely be divided into declaration matches, in which a specified maximum time or number of overs is assigned to the game in total and the teams swap roles only when the batting team is either completely dismissed or declares, and limited overs matches, which are a limited overs match in which each team's innings is assigned for each team individually\n",
      "Indoor cricket is a variant of the sport played in sports halls during the winter months.These will vary in length between 30 and 60 overs per side at the weekend and the 20-over format in the evenings.\n",
      "At still lower levels, the rules are often changed simply to make the game playable with limited resources or to render it more convenient and enjoyable for the participants.\n",
      "Informal variants of the sport can be played almost anywhere, if there is enough space.\n",
      "Four forms of cricket have been played at what may be termed the highest international or domestic level of the game.== Professional cricket ==\n",
      "Three are contested currently and one is historic.\n",
      "There is no official term for this level of cricket collectively, although the individual forms do have official designations and are defined by the International Cricket Council (ICC).\n",
      "In the past, before any official definition was agreed upon, highest standard matches were routinely described as \"great\" or \"important\" or top-class; or even \"first-class\" before this became the official term for one type of cricket (see below).\n",
      "Note that \"minor cricket\" is a term used officially in England and Wales at least.\n",
      "Matches played at the highest international and domestic levels are those in which players and/or teams of a recognized high standard are taking part.\n",

      "Test cricket, One Day Internationals (ODIs) and Twenty20 Internationals are variations of those forms within the international sphere.\n",
      "Historically (see History of cricket ) top-class matches were those held by substantial sources to have historical significance including single wicket and those double innings matches without statistical significance: i. e., lacking scorecards and other statistical data.\n",
      "The oldest known English county teams are Kent, Surrey and Sussex, all of which have histories commencing in the early 18th century.\n",
      "These counties had achieved a high standard long before their modern county clubs were founded (from 1839 to 1845), and so they have always had first-class status.\n",
      "Following a meeting in May 1894 of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the County Championship clubs, the concept of \"first-class cricket\" was officially defined.\n",
      "By 1895, several other counties had also been recognized as having first-class status, as had MCC itself from its foundation in 1787.\n",
      "Top-class limited overs cricket began in 1963 when the County Championship clubs took part in the first seasonal knockout tournament, which was won by Sussex.\n",
      "Hence, like all the other first-class counties, Sussex for example is classified as a List A team from 1963; and as a top-class Twenty20 team since 2003.\n",

      "Historically, however, there have been instances of first-class matches being arranged for less than three days and there has been others with twelve or thirteen players per side; these are exceptional cases and form a tiny percentage of the whole.\n",
      "If the game is not completed within the allotted time then it is drawn, regardless of who has scored the most runs when time expires.\n",

      "Cryptography, or cryptology (from Ancient Greek: κρυπτός, romanized: kryptós \"hidden, secret\"; and γράφειν graphein, \"to write\", or -λογία -logia, \"study\") is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior.\n",
      "More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages.\n",
      "Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, information security, electrical engineering, digital signal processing, physics and others.\n",
      "Core concepts related to information security (data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication and non-repudiation) are also central to cryptography.\n",
      "Practical applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.\n",
      "Cryptography prior to the modern age was effectively synonymous with encryption, converting readable information (plaintext) to unintelligible nonsense text (ciphertext ) which can only be read by reversing the process (decryption).\n",
      "The sender of an encrypted (coded) message shares the decryption (decoding) technique only with the intended recipients to preclude access from adversaries.\n",
      "The cryptography literature often uses the names \"Alice\" (or \"A\") for the sender, \"Bob\" or \"B\" for the intended recipient and \"Eve\" or “Eve” for the eavesdropping adversary.\n",
      "Since the development of rotor cipher machines in World War I and the advent of computers in the World War II, cryptography methods have become increasingly complex and their applications more varied.\n",
      "Modern cryptography is heavily based on mathematical theory and computer science practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms hard to break in actual practice by any adversary.\n",
      "While it is theoretically possible to break into a well-designed system, it is infeasible in actual practice to do so.\n",
      "Such schemes, if well designed, are therefore termed \"computationally secure\".\n",
      "Theoretical advances (e. g., improvements in integer factorization algorithms ) and faster computing technology require these designs to be continually reevaluated and, if necessary, adapted.\n",
      "Information-theoretically secure schemes that provably cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power are much more difficult to use in practice than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure schemes.\n",
      "The growth of cryptographic technology has raised a number of legal issues in the Information Age.\n",
      "Cryptography's potential for use as a tool for espionage and sedition has led many governments to classify it as a weapon and to limit or even prohibit its use and export.\n",
      "In some jurisdictions where the use of cryptography is legal, laws permit investigators to compel the disclosure of encryption keys for documents relevant to an investigation.\n",
      "Cryptography also plays a major role in digital rights management and copyright infringement disputes with regard to digital media.\n",
      "The first use of the term \"cryptograph\" (as opposed to \"cryptogram\" ) dates back to the 19th century—originating from \"The Gold-Bug,\" a story by Edgar Allan Poe.Until modern times, cryptography referred almost exclusively to \"encryption\", which is the process of converting ordinary information (called plaintext) into an unintelligible form (called ciphertext ).\n",
      "Decryption is the reverse, in other words, moving from the unintelligible ciphertext back to plaintext.\n",
      "A cipher (or cypher ) is a pair of algorithms that carry out the encryption and the reversing decryption.\n",
      "The detailed operation of a cipher is controlled both by the algorithm and by a \"key\".\n",
      "The key is a secret (ideally known only to the communicants, usually a string of characters ), usually short so it can be remembered by the user, which is needed to decrypt the ciphertext.\n",
      "In formal mathematical terms a \"cryptosystem\" is the ordered list of elements of finite possible plaintexts, finite possible cyphertexts, finite possible keys and the encryption and decryption algorithms that correspond to each key.\n",
      "Keys are important both formally and in actual practice as ciphers without variable keys can be trivially broken with only the knowledge of the cipher used and are therefore useless (or even counter-productive) for most purposes.\n",
      "Historically, ciphers were often used directly for encryption or decryption without additional procedures such as authentication or integrity checks.\n",
      "There are two main types of cryptosystems: symmetric and asymmetric.\n",
      "In symmetric systems, the only ones known until the 1970s, the same secret key encrypts and decrypts a message.\n",
      "Data manipulation in symmetric systems is significantly faster than in asymmetric systems.\n",
      "Asymmetric systems use a public key to encrypt a message and a related \"private key\" to decrypt it.\n",
      "The advantage of asymmetric systems is that the public key can be freely published, allowing parties to establish secure communication without having a shared secret key.\n",
      "In practice, asymmetric systems are used to first exchange a secret key and then secure communication proceeds via a more efficient symmetric system using that key.\n",
      "Examples of asymmetric systems include Diffie–Hellman key exchange, RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman), ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography), and Post-quantum cryptography.\n",
      "Secure symmetric algorithms include the commonly used AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) which replaced the older DES (Data Encrypt Standard).\n",
      "Insecure symmetric algorithms include children's language tangling schemes such as Pig Latin or other cant, and all historical cryptographic schemes, however seriously intended, prior to the invention of the one-time pad early in the 20th century.\n",
      "In colloquial use, the term \"code\" is often used to mean any method of encryption or concealment of meaning.\n",
      "In cryptography, code has a more specific meaning: the replacement of a unit of plaintext (i. e., a meaningful word or phrase) with a code word (for example, \"wallaby\" replaces \"attack at dawn\").\n",
      "A cypher is a scheme for changing or substituting an element below such a level (a letter, a syllable or a pair of letters, etc.)\n",
      "in order to produce a cyphertext.\n",
      "Cryptanalysis is the term used for the study of methods for obtaining the meaning of encrypted information without access to the key normally required to do so; i. e.the study of how to \"crack\" encryption algorithms or their implementations.\n",
      "Some use the terms \"cryptography\" and \"cryptology\" interchangeably in English while others (including US military practice generally) use the term cryptography to refer specifically to the use and practice of cryptographic techniques and cryptology to refer to the combined study of cryptography and cryptanalysis.\n",
      "English is more flexible than several other languages in which \"cryptology\" (done by cryptologists ) is always used in the second sense above.\n",
      "The study of characteristics of languages that have some application in cryptography or cryptology (e. g. steganography ) is sometimes included in cryptology.\n",
      "frequency data, letter combinations, universal patterns, etc.)\n",
      "Cryptolinguistics is called cryptolinguistic.\n",
      "Cryptolingusitics is especially used in military intelligence applications for deciphering foreign communications.\n",
      "Cryptography is the process of converting messages from a comprehensible form into an incomprehensible one and back again at the other end, rendering it unreadable by interceptors or eavesdroppers without secret knowledge (namely the key needed for decryption of that message).Before the modern era, cryptography focused on message confidentiality (i. e., encryption)—conversion of messages from comprehensible forms into an unintelligible ones and back to comprehensible ones at one end.\n",
      "Encryption attempted to ensure secrecy in communications, such as those of spies, military leaders, and diplomats.\n",
      "In recent decades, the field has expanded beyond confidentiality concerns to include techniques for message integrity checking, sender/receiver identity authentication, digital signatures, interactive proofs and secure computation.\n",
      "The main classical cipher types are transposition ciphers, which rearrange the order of letters in a message (e. g., 'hello world' becomes 'ehlol owrdl' in a trivially simple rearrangement scheme ) and substitution cipher, which systematically replace letters or groups of letters with other letters or group of letters (e. g. 'fly at once' becomes ‘gmz bu podf' by replacing each letter with the\n",
      "Simple versions of either have never offered much confidentiality from enterprising opponents.\n",
      "An early substitution cipher was the Caesar cipher, in which each letter in the plaintext was replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions further down the alphabet.\n",
      "Suetonius reports that Julius Caesar used it with a shift of three to communicate with his generals.\n",
      "Atbash is an example of an early Hebrew cipher.\n",
      "The earliest known use of cryptography is some carved ciphertext on stone in Egypt (c. 1900 BCE), but this may have been done for the amusement of literate observers rather than as a way of concealing information.\n",
      "The Greeks of Classical times are said to have known of ciphers (e. g., the scytale transposition cipher claimed to have been used by the Spartan military).\n",
      "Steganography (i. e., hiding even the existence of a message so as to keep it confidential) was also first developed in ancient times.\n",
      "An early example, from Herodotus, was a message tattooed on a slave's shaved head and concealed under the regrown hair.\n",
      "More modern examples of steganography include the use of invisible ink, microdots and digital watermarks to conceal information.\n"

      "A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, thereby completely or partially obscuring the view of the Sun from a small part of the Earth, totally or partially blocking the Sun's light.\n",
      "Such an alignment occurs approximately every six months, during the eclipse season in its new moon phase, when the Moon's orbital plane is closest to the plane of the Earth's orbit.\n",
      "In a total eclipse, the disk of the Sun is fully obscured by the Moon.\n",
      "In partial and annular eclipses, only part of the Sun is obscured.\n",
      "Unlike a lunar eclipse, which may be viewed from anywhere on the night side of Earth, a solar eclipse can only be seen from a relatively small area of the world.\n",
      "As such, although total solar eclipses occur somewhere on Earth every 18 months on average, they recur at any given place only once every 360 to 410 years.\n",
      "If the Moon were in a perfectly circular orbit and in the same orbital plane as Earth, there would be total solar eclipses once a month at every new moon.\n",
      "Instead, because the Moon's orbit is tilted at about 5 degrees to Earth's orbit, its shadow usually misses Earth.\n",
      "Solar (and lunar) eclipses therefore happen only during eclipse seasons, resulting in at least two, and up to five, solar eclipses each year, no more than two of which can be total.\n",
      "Total eclipses are more rare because they require a more precise alignment between the centers of the Sun and Moon, and because the Moon's apparent size in the sky is sometimes too small to fully cover the Sun.\n",
      "An eclipse is a natural phenomenon.\n",
      "In some ancient and modern cultures, solar eclipses were attributed to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens.\n",
      "Astronomers' predictions of eclipses began in China as early as the 4th century BC; eclipses hundreds of years into the future may now be predicted with high accuracy.\n",
      "Looking directly at the Sun can lead to permanent eye damage, so special eye protection or indirect viewing techniques are used when viewing a solar eclipse.\n",
      "Only the total phase of a total solar eclipse is safe to view without protection.\n",
      "Enthusiasts known as eclipse chasers or umbraphiles travel to remote locations to see solar eclipses.\n",
      "A total solar eclipse occurs in average every 18 months when the dark silhouette of the Moon completely obscures the intensely bright light of the Sun, allowing the much fainter solar corona to be visible.There are four types of solar eclipses:\n",
      "During any one eclipse, totality occurs at best only in a narrow track on the surface of Earth.\n",
      "This narrow track is called the path of totality.\n",
      "An annular eclipse occurs once every one or two years when the Sun and Moon are exactly in line with the Earth, but the apparent size of the Moon is smaller than that of the Sun.\n",
      "Hence the Sun appears as a very bright ring, or annulus, surrounding the dark disk of the Moon.\n",
      "A hybrid eclipse (also called annular/total eclipse ) shifts between a total and annular eclipse.\n",
      "At certain points on the surface of Earth, it appears as a total eclipse, whereas at other points it appears to be annular.\n",
      "Hybrid eclipses are comparatively rare.\n",
      "A partial eclipse occurs about twice a year when the Sun and Moon are not exactly in line with the Earth and the Moon only partially obscures the Sun.\n",
      "This phenomenon can usually be seen from a large part of the Earth outside of the track of an annular or total eclipse.\n",
      "Eclipses can be seen only as a partial eclipse because the umbra passes above the polar regions and never intersects the Earth's surface.However, some eclipses are seen as a total eclipse.\n",
      "Partial eclipses are virtually unnoticeable in terms of the Sun's brightness, as it takes well over 90% coverage to notice any darkening at all.\n",
      "The Sun's distance from Earth is about 400 times the Moon's distance, and the Sun's diameter is about 1/400 of the Moon diameter.Even at 99%, it would be no darker than civil twilight.\n",
      "The Moon's orbit around the Earth is slightly elliptical, as is the Earth's orbit.Because these ratios are approximately the same, the Sun and the Moon as seen from Earth appear the same size: about 0.5 degree of arc in angular measure.\n",
      "The apparent sizes of the Sun and Moon therefore vary.\n",
      "The magnitude of an eclipse is the ratio of the apparent size of the Moon to the apparent magnitude of the Sun during an eclipse.\n",
      "An eclipse that occurs when the Moon is near its closest distance to Earth (i. e., near its perigee ) can be a total eclipse because the Moon will appear to be large enough to completely cover the Sun's bright disk or photosphere.A total eclipse has a magnitude greater than or equal to 1.000.\n",
      "A hybrid eclipse occurs when the magnitude of an eclipse changes during the event from less to greater than one, so the eclipse appears to be total at locations nearer the midpoint of the event and annular at other locations near the beginning and end, since the sides of the Earth are slightly further away from the Moon.Conversely, an eclipse that occurs when near its farthest distance from Earth (i. e., near its apogee ) can be only an annular eclipse because\n",
      "Hybrid eclipses are extremely narrow in their path width and relatively short in their duration at any point compared with fully total eclipses; the 2023 April 20 hybrid eclipse's totality is over a minute in duration at various points along the path of totality.\n",
      "Like a focal point, the width and duration of totality and annularity are near zero at the points where the changes between the two occur.Because the Earth's orbit around the Sun is also elliptical, the distance from the Sun similarly varies throughout the year.\n",
      "This affects the apparent size of the Sun in the same way as does the Moon's varying distance from Earth.\n",
      "When Earth approaches its farthest distance from the Sun in early July, a total eclipse is somewhat more likely to occur, whereas conditions favour an annular eclipse in early January.\n",
      "Central eclipse is often used as a generic term for a total, annular, or hybrid eclipse.=== Terminology for central eclipse === Central eclipse is a type of total or annular eclipse\n",
      "This is, however, not completely correct: the definition of a central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches the Earth's surface.\n",
      "It is possible that part of the umbra intersects with the Earth (thus creating an annular or total eclipse ) but not its central line.\n",
      "This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse.\n",
      "Gamma is a measure of how centrally the shadow strikes.\n",
      "The last (umbral yet) non-central solar eclipse was on April 29, 2014.\n",
      "This was an annular eclipse.\n",
      "The visual phases observed during a total eclipse are called:First contact—when the Moon's limb (edge) is exactly tangential to the Sun's limb; Second contact—the Moon's edge (edge ) is directly in contact with the Sun; and Third Contact—the Sun's edge is directly touching the Moon\n",
      "Second contact—starting with Baily's Beads (caused by light shining through valleys on the Moon's surface) and the diamond ring effect.\n",
      "Almost the entire disk is covered.\n",
      "Totality—the Moon obscures the entire disk of the Sun and only the solar corona is visible.\n",
      "Third contact—when the first bright light becomes visible and the Moon's shadow is moving away from the observer.\n",
      "Again a diamond ring may be observed.\n",
      "Fourth contact—when the trailing edge of the Moon ceases to overlap with the solar disk and the eclipse ends.\n",
      "The diagrams to the right show the alignment of the Sun, Moon, and Earth during a solar eclipse.== Predictions ===== Geometry ===\n",
      "The dark gray region between the Moon and Earth is the umbra, where the Sun is completely obscured by the Moon.\n",
      "The small area where the umbra touches Earth's surface is where a total eclipse can be seen.\n",
      "The larger light gray area is the penumbra, in which a partial eclipse can be seen.\n",
      "An observer in the antumbra, the area of shadow beyond the umbra, will see an annular eclipse.The Moon's orbit around the Earth is inclined at an angle of just over 5 degrees to the plane of the Earth's orbit (the ecliptic).\n",
      "Because of this, at the time of a new moon, the Moon will usually pass to the north or south of the Sun.\n",
      "A solar eclipse can occur only when a new moon occurs close to one of the points (known as nodes) where the Moon's orbit crosses the ecliptic.As noted above, the Moon is also elliptical.\n",
      "The Moon's distance from the Earth can vary by about 6% from its average value.\n",
      "The Moon's apparent size varies with its distance from the Earth, and it is this effect that leads to the difference between total and annular eclipses.\n",
      "The distance of the Earth from the Sun also varies during the year, but this is a smaller effect.\n",
      "On average, the Moon appears to be slightly smaller than the Sun as seen from the Earth, so the majority (about 60%) of central eclipses are annular.\n",
      "It is only when the Moon is closer to the Earth than average (near its perigee ) that a total eclipse occurs.\n",
      "The Moon orbits the Earth in approximately 27.3 days, relative to a fixed frame of reference.\n",
      "This is known as the sidereal month.\n",
      "However, during one sidereal month, Earth has revolved part way around the Sun, making the average time between one new moon and the next longer than the sidereal months: it is approximately 29.5 days.\n",
      "The Moon crosses from south to north of the ecliptic at its ascending node and vice versa at its descending node.This is known as the synodic month and corresponds to what is commonly called the lunar month.\n",
      "However, the nodes of the Moon's orbit are gradually moving in a retrograde motion due to the action of the Sun's gravity on the motion, and they make a complete circuit every 18.6 years.\n",
      "This regression means that the time between each passage of the Moon through the ascending node is slightly shorter than the sidereal month.\n"

      "Classical physics, the collection of theories that existed before the advent of quantum mechanics, describes many aspects of nature at an ordinary (macroscopic) scale but is not sufficient for describing them at small (atomic and subatomic) scales.\n",
      "Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities of a bound system are restricted to discrete values (quantization); measurements of systems show characteristics of both particles and waves (wave–particle duality); and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation\n",
      "Quantum mechanics arose gradually from theories to explain observations that could not be reconciled with classical physics, such as Max Planck's solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem, and the correspondence between energy and frequency in Albert Einstein's 1905 paper, which explained the photoelectric effect.\n",
      "Quantum mechanics is the theory of how the world works in space and time.It was developed in the mid-1920s by Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Paul Dirac and others.These early attempts to understand microscopic phenomena, now known as the \"old quantum theory\", led to the full development of quantum mechanics in the late 1920s and early 1930s.\n",
      "The modern theory is formulated in various specially developed mathematical formalisms.\n",
      "In one of them, a mathematical entity called the wave function provides information about what measurements of a particle's energy, momentum and other physical properties may yield.\n",
      "Quantum mechanics allows the calculation of properties and behaviour of physical systems.== Overview and fundamental concepts ==\n",
      "It is typically applied to microscopic systems: molecules, atoms and sub-atomic particles.\n",
      "It has been demonstrated to hold for complex molecules with thousands of atoms but its application to human beings raises philosophical problems, such as Wigner's friend, and it remains speculative.\n",
      "Predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree of accuracy.\n",
      "For example, the refinement of quantum mechanics for the interaction of light and matter, known as quantum electrodynamics (QED ) has been shown to agree with experiment to within 1 part in 108 for some atomic properties.\n",
      "A fundamental feature of the theory is that it usually cannot predict with certainty what will happen, but only give probabilities.\n",
      "Mathematically, a probability is found by taking the square of the absolute value of a complex number, known as a probability amplitude.\n",
      "This is known as the Born rule, named after physicist Max Born.\n",
      "For example, a quantum particle like an electron can be described by a wave function, which associates to each point in space a probability amplitude.\n",
      "Applying the Born rule to these amplitudes gives a probability density function for the position that the electron will be found to have when an experiment is performed to measure it.\n",
      "This is the best the theory can do; it cannot say for certain where the electron will be found.\n",
      "The Schrödinger equation relates the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to one moment of time to the collection that pertains to another.\n",
      "One consequence of the mathematical rules of quantum mechanics is a tradeoff in predictability between different measurable quantities.\n",
      "The most famous form of this uncertainty principle says that no matter how a quantum particle is prepared or how carefully experiments upon it are arranged, it is impossible to have a precise prediction for a measurement of its position and also at the same time for its momentum.\n",
      "Quantum mechanics is a mathematical theory that describes the phenomenon of quantum interference, which is often illustrated with the double-slit experiment.\n",
      "In the basic version of this experiment, a coherent light source illuminates a plate pierced by two parallel slits and the light passing through the slits is observed on a screen behind the plate.\n",
      "Light waves passing through the two slits to interfere with each other, producing bright and dark bands on the screen – a result that would not be expected if light consisted of classical particles. The wave nature of light causes the light waves passing to interfere to interfere, producing the bright and the dark bands.\n",
      "However, the light is always found to be absorbed at the screen at discrete points rather than waves; the interference pattern appears via the varying density of these particle hits on the screen.\n",
      "Furthermore, versions of the experiment that include detectors at the slits find that each detected photon passes through one slit (as would a classical particle particle ) and not through both slits ( as would a wave).\n",
      "In this article, we demonstrate that particles do not form the interference pattern if one detects which slit they pass through.: 109 \n",
      "This behavior is known as wave–particle duality.\n",
      "In addition to light, electrons, atoms and molecules are all found to exhibit the same dual behavior when fired towards a double slit.Another non-classical phenomenon predicted by quantum mechanics is quantum tunnelling: a particle that goes up against a potential barrier can cross it even if its kinetic energy is smaller than the maximum of the potential.\n",
      "In classical mechanics this particle would be trapped.\n",
      "When quantum systems interact, the result can be the creation of quantum entanglement: their properties become so intertwined that a description of the whole solely in terms of the individual parts is no longer possible.Quantum tunnelling has several important consequences, enabling radioactive decay, nuclear fusion in stars and applications such as scanning tunnelled microscopy and the tunnel diode.\n",
      "Erwin Schrödinger called entanglement \"...the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought\".\n",
      "Quantum entanglement enables quantum computing and is part of quantum communication protocols such as quantum key distribution and superdense coding.\n",
      "Contrary to popular misconception, entanglement does not allow sending signals faster than light, as demonstrated by the no-communication theorem.Another possibility opened by entanglements is testing for \"hidden variables\", hypothetical properties more fundamental than the quantities addressed in quantum theory itself, knowledge of which would allow more exact predictions than quantum theory can provide.\n",
      "A collection of results, most significantly Bell's theorem, have demonstrated that broad classes of such hidden-variable theories are in fact incompatible with quantum physics.\n",
      "According to Bell's theorem, if nature actually operates in accord with any theory of local hidden variables, then the results of a Bell test will be constrained in a particular, quantifiable way.\n",
      "It is not possible to present these concepts in more than a superficial way without introducing the actual mathematics involved; understanding quantum mechanics requires not only manipulating complex numbers but also linear algebra, differential equations, group theory and other more advanced subjects.Many Bell tests have been performed, using entangled particles and they have shown results incompatible with the constraints imposed by local hidden variables.\n",
      "Accordingly, this article will present a mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics and survey its application to some useful and oft-studied examples.\n",
      "In the mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics, the state of a quantum mechanical system is a vector                    , belonging to a (separable ) complex Hilbert space ψ ( ψ ), where ψ is a Hilbert space, and ψ   is a space of complex Hilbert spaces. The state of the system is defined as a vector ψ, which is defined by ψ in the form of ψε ( σ ).\n",

It is well defined up to the global phase up to 1 (1/1 ), and is well\n",
      "In other words, the possible states are points in the projective space of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective spaces.\n",

      "=== Demographics of market participation ====== Indirect vs. Direct\n",
      "Direct Investment ====Indirect investment involves owning shares indirectly, such as via a mutual fund or an exchange traded fund.\n",
      "Direct investment involves direct ownership of shares.Direct ownership of stock by individuals rose slightly from 17.8% in 1992 to 17.9% in 2007, with the median value of these holdings rising from $14,778 to $17,000.\n",

      "Rydqvist, Spizman, and Strebulaev attribute the differential growth in direct and indirect holdings to differences in the way each are taxed in the United States.\n",
      "Investments in pension funds and 401ks, the two most common vehicles of indirect participation, are taxed only when funds are withdrawn from the accounts.\n",
      "Conversely, the money used to directly purchase stock is subject to taxation as are any dividends or capital gains they generate for the holder.\n",
      "In this way, the current tax code incentivizes individuals to invest indirectly.\n",
      "Rates of participation and the value of holdings differ significantly across strata of income.==== Participation by income and wealth strata ====\n",
      "In the bottom quintile of income, 5.5% of households directly own stock and 10.7% hold stocks indirectly in the form of retirement accounts.\n",
      "The top decile of income has a direct participation rate of 47.5% and an indirect participation rate in the form of retirement accounts of 89.6%.\n",
      "The median value of directly owned stock in the bottom quintile of income is $4,000 and is $78,600 in the top decile as of 2007.\n",
      "The median value of indirectly held stock in the form of retirement accounts for the same two groups in the same year is $6,300 and $214,800 respectively.\n",
      "Since the Great Recession of 2008 households in the bottom half of the income distribution have lessened their participation rate both directly and indirectly from 53.2% in 2007 to 48.8% in 2013, while over the same period households of the top decile increased participation 91.7% to 92.1%.\n",
      "The mean value of direct and indirect holdings at the bottom half of the income distribution moved slightly downward from $53,800 in 2007 to $53,600 in 2013.\n",
      "In the top decile, mean value of all holdings fell from $982,000 to $969,300 in the same time.\n",
      "The mean value of all stock holdings across the entire income distribution is valued at $269,900 as of 2013.\n",
      "The racial composition of stock market ownership shows households headed by whites are nearly four and six times as likely to directly own stocks than those headed by blacks and Hispanics respectively.==== Participation by race and gender ====\n",
      "As of 2011 the national rate of direct participation was 19.6%, for white households the participation rate was 24.5%, for black households it was 6.4% and for Hispanic households 4.3%.\n",
      "Indirect participation in the form of 401k ownership shows a similar pattern with a national participation rate of 42.1%, a rate of 46.4% for white households, 31.7% for black households, and 25.8% for Hispanic households.\n",
      "Households headed by married couples participated at rates above the national averages with 25.6% participating directly and 53.4% participating indirectly through a retirement account.\n",

      "It was a 65-centimetre-long (26 in) scale-model toy for the Kangxi Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger.\n",
      "Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle.It is not known with certainty if Verbiest's model was successfully built or run.\n",
      "He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army, one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts.\n",
      "His inventions were limited by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure.\n",
      "In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle.\n",
      "It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use.\n",
      "The development of external combustion (steam) engines is detailed as part of the history of the car but often treated separately from the development of true cars.\n",
      "A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons and steam rollers.\n",
      "In the United Kingdom, sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865.\n",
      "In 1807 Nicéphore Niépce and his brother Claude created what was probably the world's first internal combustion engine (which they called a Pyréolophore ) but installed it in a boat on the river Saone in France.\n",
      "Coincidentally, in 1807, the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed his own \"de Rivaz internal combustion engine\", and used it to develop the world's first vehicle to be powered by such an engine.\n",
      "The Niépces' Pyréolophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder, finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil that was mixed with hydrogen and oxygen.\n",
      "In November 1881, French inventor Gustave Trouvé demonstrated a three-wheeled car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity in Paris.Trouvé was the first to demonstrate a vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine at an international exposition of electricity and the first electric car to be built in Europe.Neither design was successful, as was the case with others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey and Etienne Lenoir, who each built\n",
      "Although several other German engineers (including Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach, and Siegfried Marcus ) were working on cars at about the same time, the year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—when the German Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen; he is generally acknowledged as the inventor of the car.In 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had\n",
      "Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle.\n",

      "Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893 when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a cheaper model.\n",
      "They also were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design.\n",
      "Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products.\n",
      "Because France was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany.\n",
      "In August 1888, Bertha Benz, the wife of Carl Benz, undertook the first road trip by car to prove the road-worthiness of her husband's invention.\n",
      "In 1896, Benz designed and patented the first internal-combustion flat engine, called boxermotor.\n",
      "During the last years of the 19th century, Benz was the largest car company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899 and, because of its size, Benz & Cie., became a joint-stock company.\n",

      "Daimler and Maybach founded Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) in Cannstatt in 1890, and sold their first car in 1892 under the brand name.\n",
      "It was a horse-drawn stagecoach built by another manufacturer, which they retrofitted with an engine of their design.\n",
      "By 1895, about 30 vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach, either at the works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after disputes with their backers.\n",
      "Benz, Maybach, and the Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other's early work.\n",
      "Daimler and Maybach were two German automobile companies that merged in the 1950s and 1960s.They never worked together; by the time of the merger of the two companies, Daimler was no longer part of DMG.\n",
      "Daimler died in 1900 and later that year, Maybach designed an engine named Daimler-Mercedes that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by Emil Jellinek.\n",
      "This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country.\n",
      "Two years later, in 1902, a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine, which generated 35 hp.\n",

      "It was a 65-centimetre-long (26 in) scale-model toy for the Kangxi Emperor that was unable to carry a driver or a passenger.\n",
      "Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot is widely credited with building the first full-scale, self-propelled mechanical vehicle in about 1769; he created a steam-powered tricycle.It is not known with certainty if Verbiest's model was successfully built or run.\n",
      "He also constructed two steam tractors for the French Army, one of which is preserved in the French National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts.\n",
      "His inventions were limited by problems with water supply and maintaining steam pressure.\n",
      "In 1801, Richard Trevithick built and demonstrated his Puffing Devil road locomotive, believed by many to be the first demonstration of a steam-powered road vehicle.\n",
      "It was unable to maintain sufficient steam pressure for long periods and was of little practical use.\n",
      "The development of external combustion (steam) engines is detailed as part of the history of the car but often treated separately from the development of true cars.\n",
      "A variety of steam-powered road vehicles were used during the first part of the 19th century, including steam cars, steam buses, phaetons and steam rollers.\n",
      "In the United Kingdom, sentiment against them led to the Locomotive Acts of 1865.\n",
      "In 1807 Nicéphore Niépce and his brother Claude created what was probably the world's first internal combustion engine (which they called a Pyréolophore ) but installed it in a boat on the river Saone in France.\n",
      "Coincidentally, in 1807, the Swiss inventor François Isaac de Rivaz designed his own \"de Rivaz internal combustion engine\", and used it to develop the world's first vehicle to be powered by such an engine.\n",
      "The Niépces' Pyréolophore was fuelled by a mixture of Lycopodium powder, finely crushed coal dust and resin that were mixed with oil that was mixed with hydrogen and oxygen.\n",
      "In November 1881, French inventor Gustave Trouvé demonstrated a three-wheeled car powered by electricity at the International Exposition of Electricity in Paris.Trouvé was the first to demonstrate a vehicle powered by an internal combustion engine at an international exposition of electricity and the first electric car to be built in Europe.Neither design was successful, as was the case with others, such as Samuel Brown, Samuel Morey and Etienne Lenoir, who each built\n",
      "Although several other German engineers (including Gottlieb Daimler, Wilhelm Maybach, and Siegfried Marcus ) were working on cars at about the same time, the year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—when the German Carl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen; he is generally acknowledged as the inventor of the car.In 1879, Benz was granted a patent for his first engine, which had\n",
      "Many of his other inventions made the use of the internal combustion engine feasible for powering a vehicle.\n",

      "Benz began promotion of the vehicle on 3 July 1886, and about 25 Benz vehicles were sold between 1888 and 1893 when his first four-wheeler was introduced along with a cheaper model.\n",
      "They also were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design.\n",
      "Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products.\n",
      "Because France was more open to the early cars, initially more were built and sold in France through Roger than Benz sold in Germany.\n",
      "In August 1888, Bertha Benz, the wife of Carl Benz, undertook the first road trip by car to prove the road-worthiness of her husband's invention.\n",
      "In 1896, Benz designed and patented the first internal-combustion flat engine, called boxermotor.\n",
      "During the last years of the 19th century, Benz was the largest car company in the world with 572 units produced in 1899 and, because of its size, Benz & Cie., became a joint-stock company.\n",
      "The first motor car in central Europe and one of the first factory-made cars in the world was produced by Czech company Nesselsdorfer Wagenbau (later renamed to Tatra) in 1897, the Präsident automobil.\n",
      "Daimler and Maybach founded Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG) in Cannstatt in 1890, and sold their first car in 1892 under the brand name.\n",
      "It was a horse-drawn stagecoach built by another manufacturer, which they retrofitted with an engine of their design.\n",
      "By 1895, about 30 vehicles had been built by Daimler and Maybach, either at the works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after disputes with their backers.\n",
      "Benz, Maybach, and the Daimler team seem to have been unaware of each other's early work.\n",
      "Daimler and Maybach were two German automobile companies that merged in the 1950s and 1960s.They never worked together; by the time of the merger of the two companies, Daimler was no longer part of DMG.\n",
      "Daimler died in 1900 and later that year, Maybach designed an engine named Daimler-Mercedes that was placed in a specially ordered model built to specifications set by Emil Jellinek.\n",
      "This was a production of a small number of vehicles for Jellinek to race and market in his country.\n",
      "Two years later, in 1902, a new model DMG car was produced and the model was named Mercedes after the Maybach engine, which generated 35 hp.\n",
      "Maybach quit DMG shortly thereafter and opened a business of his own.\n",
      "Rights to the Daimler brand name were sold to other manufacturers.\n",
      "In 1890, Émile Levassor and Armand Peugeot of France began producing vehicles with Daimler engines and so laid the foundation of the automotive industry in France.\n",
      "In 1891, Auguste Doriot and his Peugeot colleague Louis Rigoulot completed the longest trip by a petrol-driven vehicle when their self-designed and built Daimler powered Type 3 completed 2,100 kilometres (1,300 mi) from Valentigney to Paris and Brest and back again.\n"

      "Association football is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each, who primarily use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch.It is also known as football or soccer.\n",
      "The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by an opposing team.\n",
      "Traditionally, the game has been played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes.\n",
      "With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.\n",
      "The game of association football is played in accordance with the Laws of the Game, a set of rules that has been in effect since 1863 and maintained by the IFAB since 1886.\n",
      "The game is played with a football that is 68–70 cm (27–28 in) in circumference.\n",
      "The two teams compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal.\n",
      "When the ball is in play, the players mainly use their feet, but may use any other part of their body, except for their hands or arms, to control, strike, or pass the ball.\n",
      "Only the goalkeepers may use their hands and arms, and only then within the penalty area.\n",
      "The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner.\n",

      "Association football is one of a family of football codes that emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity.== Name == Association Football\n",
      "Within the English-speaking world, the sport is now usually called \"football\" in Great Britain and most of Ulster in the north of Ireland, whereas people usually call it \"soccer\" in regions and countries where other codes of football are prevalent, such as Australia, Canada, South Africa, most of Ireland (excluding Ulster), and the United States.\n",
      "A notable exception is New Zealand, where in the first two decades of the 21st century, under the influence of international television, \"football\" has been gaining prevalence, despite the dominance of other codes of football, namely rugby union and rugby league.The term soccer comes from Oxford \"-er\" slang, which was prevalent at the University of Oxford in England from about 1875 and is thought to have been borrowed from the slang of Rugby School.\n",
      "Initially spelt assoccer, it was later reduced to the modern spelling.\n",
      "This form of slang also gave rise to rugger for rugby football, fiver and tenner for five pound and ten pound notes and the now-archaic footer that was also a name for association football.\n",
      "The word soccer arrived at its current form in 1895 and was first recorded in 1889 in the earlier form of socca.\n",
      "Kicking ball games arose independently multiple times across multiple cultures.== History ==\n",
      "Phaininda and episkyros were Greek ball games.\n",
      "An image of an episkyros player depicted in low relief on a stele of c. 375–400 BCE in the National Archaeological Museum of Athens appears on the UEFA European Championship trophy.\n",
      "Athenaeus, writing in 228 CE, mentions the Roman ball game harpastum.\n",
      "Phaininda, episkyros and harpastum were played involving hands and violence.\n",
      "They all appear to have resembled rugby football, wrestling, and volleyball more than what is recognisable as modern football.\n",
      "The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠, literally \"kick ball\"; also known as tsu chu ) resembles association football.As with pre-codified mob football, the antecedent of all modern football codes, these three games involved more handling the ball than kicking it.\n",
      "Cuju players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was to kick a ball through an opening into a net.\n",
      "During the Han dynasty (202 BCE – 220 CE), cuju games were standardised and rules were established.\n",
      "Other East Asian games included kemari in Japan and chuk-guk in Korea, both influenced by cuju.\n",
      "Kemari originated after the year 600 during the Asuka period.\n",
      "It was a ceremonial rather than a competitive game, and involved the kicking of a mari, a ball made of animal skin.\n",
      "The predecessors of association football in themselves do not have a classical history.In North America, pasuckuakohowog was a ball game played by the Algonquians; it was described as \"almost identical to the kind of folk football being played in Europe at the same time, in which the ball was kicked through goals\".\n",
      "Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world, FIFA has described that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe.\n",
      "The history of kicking ball in England dates back to at least the eighth century.\n",
      "The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England.\n",
      "The Cambridge rules, first drawn up at the University of Cambridge in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes including association football.\n",
      "The Cambridge rules were written at Trinity College, Cambridge, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury schools.\n",
      "They were not universally adopted.\n",
      "During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world to play various forms of football.\n",
      "Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club formed by former public school pupils in 1857, which led to the formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867.\n",
      "In 1862, John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules.\n",
      "These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons' Tavern in Great Queen Street, London.\n",
      "The only school to be represented on this occasion was Charterhouse.\n",
      "The Freemasons' Tavern was the setting for five more meetings of The FA between October and December 1863; the English FA eventually issued the first comprehensive set of rules named Laws of the Game on 8 December 1863, forming football.\n",
      "The laws included bans on running with the ball in hand and hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding.\n",
      "Eleven clubs, under the charge of FA secretary Ebenezer Cobb Morley, ratified the original thirteen laws of the game.\n",
      "The sticking point was hacking, which a twelfth club at the meeting, Blackheath FC, had wanted to keep, resulting in them withdrawing from the FA.\n",
      "Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA, and instead in 1871, along with Blackheath, formed the Rugby Football Union.\n",
      "The FA rules included handling of the ball by \"marks\" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to Victorian rules football being developed at that time in Australia.\n",
      "The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s, with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.\n",
      "On 19 December 1863, Barnes played neighbouring Richmond in the first ever match under the Laws of the Game; this 15-a-side clash ended in a goalless draw.\n",
      "The world's oldest football competition is the FA Cup, which was founded by the footballer and cricketer Charles W. Alcock in 1872 and has been contested by English teams since 1872.\n",
      "The first official international football match also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in Glasgow, again at the instigation of Alcock.\n",
      "England is also home to the world's first football league, which was founded in Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor.\n",
      "The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and Northern England.Laws of the Game are determined by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).\n",
      "The Football Association Board was formed in 1886 after a meeting in Manchester of the Football Association, the Scottish Football Association, the Football League of Wales and the Irish Football Association.\n",
      "FIFA, the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to the Laws of the Game of the Football Association.\n",
      "The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the IFAB in 1913.\n",
      "For most of the 20th century, Europe and South America were the dominant regions in association football.The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations.\n",

      "Photography was introduced in 1839, but initially photographic emulsions needed such long exposures that the recording of moving subjects seemed impossible.\n",
      "At least as early as 1844, photographic series of subjects posed in different positions were created to either suggest a motion sequence or document a range of different viewing angles.\n",
      "The advent of stereoscopic photography in the 1840s and commercial success since the early 1850s raised interest in completing the photographic medium with the addition of means to capture colour and motion.\n",
      "In 1849, Joseph Plateau published about the idea to combine his invention of the phénakisticope with the stereoscope, as suggested to him by stereoscope inventor Charles Wheatstone, and to use photographs of plaster sculptures in different positions to be animated in the combined device.\n",
      "In 1852, Jules Duboscq patented such an instrument as the \"Stéréoscope-fantascope, ou Bïoscope\", but he only marketed it very briefly, without success.\n",
      "One Bïoscope disc with stereoscopic photographs of a machine is in the Plateau collection of Ghent University, but no instruments or other discs have yet been found.\n",
      "By the late 1850s the first examples of instantaneous photography came about and provided hope that motion photography would soon be possible but it took a few decades before it was successfully combined with a method to record series of sequential images in real-time.\n",
      "In 1878, Eadweard Muybridge eventually managed to take a series of photographs of a running horse with a battery of cameras in a line along the track and published the results as The Horse in Motion on cabinet cards.\n",
      "Muybridge, as well as Étienne-Jules Marey, Ottomar Anschütz and many others, would create many more chronophotography studies.\n",
      "Muybridge had the contours of dozens of his chronophotographic series traced onto glass discs and projected them with his zoopraxiscope in his lectures from 1880 to 1895.\n",
      "Anschütz made his first instantaneous photographs in 1881.\n",
      "He developed a portable camera that allowed shutter speeds as short as 1/1000 of a second in 1882.\n",
      "The quality of his pictures was generally regarded to be much higher than that of the chronophotography works Muybridge and Étienne-Jules Marey.\n",
      "In 1886, Anschütz developed the Electrotachyscope, an early device that displayed short motion picture loops with 24 glass plate photographs on a 1.5 meter wide rotating wheel that was hand-cranked to the speed of circa 30 frames per second.\n",
      "Different versions were shown at many international exhibitions, fairs, conventions and arcades from 1887 until at least 1894.\n",
      "Starting in 1891, some 152 examples of a coin-operated peep-box Electrotachyscope model were manufactured by Siemens & Halske in Berlin and sold internationally.\n",
      "Nearly 34,000 people paid to see it at the Berlin Exhibition Park in summer 1892.\n",
      "On 25 November 1894, Anschütz introduced a Electrotachyscope projector with a 6x8 meter screening in Berlin.Others saw it in London or at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair.\n",
      "Between 22 February and 30 March 1895, a total of circa 7,000 paying customers came to view a 1.5-hour show of some 40 scenes at a 300-seat hall in the old Reichstag building in Berlin.\n",
      "Émile Reynaud already mentioned the possibility of projecting the images of the Praxinoscope in his 1877 patent application.\n",
      "He presented a praxinoscope projection device at the Société française de photographie on 4 June 1880, but did not market his projectors a projection before 1882.\n",
      "He then further developed the device into the Théâtre Optique which could project longer sequences with separate backgrounds, patented in 1888.\n",
      "He created several movies for the machine by painting images on hundreds of gelatin plates that were mounted into cardboard frames and attached to a cloth band.\n",
      "From 28 October 1892 to March 1900 Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the Musée Grévin in Paris.\n",
      "By the end of the 1880s, the introduction of lengths of celluloid photographic film and the invention of motion picture cameras, which could photograph a rapid sequence of images using only one lens, allowed action to be captured and stored on a single compact reel of film.=== First motion pictures ===\n",
      "Movies were initially shown publicly to one person at a time through \"peep show\" devices such as the Electrotachyscope, Kinetoscope and the Mutoscope.\n",
      "Not much later, exhibitors managed to project films on large screens for theatre audiences.\n",
      "The first public screenings of films at which admission was charged were made in 1895 by the American Woodville Latham and his sons using films produced by their Eidoloscope company and by the – arguably better known – French brothers Auguste and Louis Lumière with ten of their own productions.\n",
      "Private screenings had preceded these by several months, with Latham's slightly predating the others´s.\n",
      "The earliest films were simply one static shot that showed an event or action with no editing or other cinematic techniques.=== Early evolution ===\n",
      "Typical films showed employees leaving a factory gate, people walking in the street and the view from the front of a trolley as it traveled a city's Main Street.\n",
      "According to legend, when a film showed a locomotive at high speed approaching the audience, the audience panicked and ran from the theater.\n",
      "Around the turn of the 20th century, films started stringing several scenes together to tell a story.\n"

      "Personal finance is the financial management which an individual or a family unit performs to budget, save and spend monetary resources over time, taking into account various financial risks and future life events.\n",
      "When planning personal finances, the individual would consider the suitability to their needs of a range of banking products (checking, savings accounts, credit cards and consumer loans ) or investment in private equity (companies' shares, bonds, mutual funds) and insurance (life insurance, health insurance, disability insurance ) products or participation and monitoring of and- or employer-sponsored retirement plans, social security benefits, and income tax management.\n",
      "The earliest known research in personal finance was done in 1920 by Hazel Kyrk.== History ==Before a specialty in personal Finance was developed, various disciplines which are closely related to it were taught in various colleges as part of home economics for over 100 years.== Education ==\n",
      "Her dissertation at University of Chicago laid the foundation of consumer economics and family economics.\n",
      "In 1947, Herbert A. Simon, a Nobel laureate, suggested that a decision-maker did not always make the best financial decision because of limited educational resources and personal inclinations.Margaret Reid, a professor of Home Economics at the same university, is recognized as one of the pioneers in the study of consumer behavior and Household behavior.\n",
      "In 2009, Dan Ariely suggested the 2008 financial crisis showed that human beings do not always make rational financial decisions and the market is not necessarily automated and corrective of any imbalances in the economy.Research into personal finance is based on several theories such as social exchange theory and andragogy (adult learning theory).\n",
      "Professional bodies such as American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences and the American Council on Consumer Interests started to play an important role in developing this field from the 1950s to the 1970s.\n",
      "The establishment of the Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education (AFCPE) in 1984 at Iowa State University and the Academy of Financial Services (AFS) in 1985 marked an important milestone in personal finance history.\n",
      "Attendances of the two societies mainly come from faculty and graduates from business and home economics colleges.\n",
      "AFCPE started to offered several certifications for professionals in this field, such as Accredited Financial Counselor (AFC) and Certified Housing Counselor.\n",
      "Before 1990, the study of personal finance received little attention from mainstream economists and business faculties.Meanwhile, AFS cooperates with Certified Financial Planner (CFP Board).\n",
      "However, several American universities such as Brigham Young University, Iowa State University and San Francisco State University started to offer financial educational programs in both undergraduate and graduate programs since the 1990s.\n",
      "These institutions published several works in journals such as The Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning and the Journal of Personal Finance.\n",
      "As the concerns about consumers' financial capability increased during the early 2000s, various education programs emerged, catering to a broad audience or a specific group of people, such as youth and women.\n",
      "The educational programs are frequently known as \"financial literacy\".\n",
      "However, there was no standardized curriculum for personal finance education until after the 2008 financial crisis.\n",
      "The United States President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability was set up in 2008 to encourage financial literacy among the American people.\n",
      "It also stressed the importance of developing a standard in financial education.\n",
      "Individual situations vary significantly when it comes to income, wealth, and consumption requirements.== Personal finance principles ==\n",
      "Moreover, tax and financial regulations vary between countries and market conditions change both geographically and over time.\n",
      "This means that advice for one person might not be appropriate for another.\n",
      "A financial advisor can offer personalized advice in complicated situations and for high-wealth individuals.\n",
      "The key component of personal finance is financial planning, a dynamic process requiring regular monitoring and re-evaluation.Still, University of Chicago professor Harold Pollack and personal finance writer Helaine Olen argue that in the United States, good personal finance advice boils down to a few simple points:Pay off credit card balances every month in full and in full, save 20% of income for retirement, and create an emergency fund that can last at least 6 months.When investing savings:Avoid\n",
      "In general, it involves five steps:Assessment: A person's financial situation is assessed by compiling simplified versions of financial statements, including balance sheets and income statements.\n",
      "A personal balance sheet lists the values of personal assets (e. g., car, house, clothes, stocks, bank account, cryptocurrencies), along with personal liabilities (e. g., credit card debt, bank loan, mortgage).\n",
      "A personal income statement lists personal income and expenses.\n",
      "Goal setting: Multiple goals are expected, including short- and long-term goals.\n",
      "For example, a long-term goal would be to \"retire at age 65 with a personal net worth of $1,000,000\", while a short-term one is to \"save up for a new computer in the next month.\"\n",
      "Setting financial goals helps to direct financial planning.\n",
      "Goal setting is done to meet specific financial requirements.\n",
      "Plan creation: The financial plan details how to accomplish the goals.\n",
      "It could include, for example, reducing unnecessary expenses, increasing employment income or investing in the stock market.\n",
      "Execution: Execution of a financial plan often requires discipline and perseverance.\n",
      "Many people obtain assistance from professionals such as accountants, financial planners, investment advisers, and lawyers.\n",
      "Monitoring and reassessment: The financial plan is monitored for possible adjustments or reassessments as time passes.Need for Personal FinanceThere is a great need for people to understand and take control of their finances.Typical goals that most adults and young adults have are paying off credit card/student loan/housing/car loan debt, investing for retirement, investing for college costs for children, and paying medical expenses.\n",
      "These are some of the overarching reasons for it;1.\n",
      "No formal education for personal finance: Most countries have a formal education across most disciplines or areas of study.\n",
      "Their pursuit translates to earning tangible outcomes in the form of money.\n",
      "Even when we realize the above to be a primary objective, there is no formal education at an elementary level in schools or colleges to learn money management or personal finance.\n",
      "Hence, it is essential to understand this gap or disconnect in the education system where there is no formal way of equipping individuals to manage their own money.This illustrates the need to learn personal finance from an early stage to differentiate between needs vs. wants and plan accordingly.\n",
      "2.\n",
      "Shortened employable age: Over the years, with the advent of automation and changing needs; it has been witnessed across the globe that several jobs that require manual intervention or that are mechanical are increasingly becoming redundant.\n",
      "Several employment opportunities are shifting from countries with higher labor costs to countries with lower labor costs keeping margins low for companies.\n",
      "In economies with a considerably large younger population entering the workforce who are more equipped with the latest technologies, several employees in the middle management who have not up-skilled are easily replaceable with new and fresh talent that is cheaper and more valuable to the organizations.\n",
      "Cyclical nature of several industries like automobile, chemicals, construction; consumption and demand is driven by the health of the countries economy.\n",
      "It has been observed that when economies stagnate, are in recession, and in war - specific industries suffer more than others.\n",
      "This results in companies rationalizing their workforce.\n",
      "An individual can lose their job quickly and remain unemployed for a considerable time.\n",
      "All these reasons bring to the realization that the legal employable age of 60 is slowly and gradually becoming shorter. Therefore, individuals should start planning for their retirement and systematically build on their retirement corpus, hence the need for personal finance.\n",

      "Increased life expectancy: With the developments in healthcare, people today live till a much older age than their forefathers.\n",
      "The average life expectancy has changed, and people, even in developing economies, live much longer.\n",
      "The average life expectancy has gradually shifted from 60 to 81 and upwards.\n",
      "Increased life expectancy coupled with a shorter employable age reinforces the need for a large enough retirement corpus and the importance of personal finance.\n",

      "Rising medical expenses: Medical expenses including cost of prescription medicine, hospital admission care and charges, nursing care, specialized care, geriatric care have all seen an exponential rise over the years.\n",

      "Since then, as the cost of solar electricity has fallen, the number of grid-connected solar PV systems' capacity and production have grown more or less exponentially, doubling about every three years.\n",
      "In 2022 solar generated 4.5% of the world's electricity, compared to 1% in 2015 when the Paris Agreement to limit climate change was signed.Millions of installations and gigawatt-scale photovoltaic power stations continue to be built, with half of new generation capacity being solar in 2021.\n",
      "Almost half the solar power installed in 2022 was rooftop.Along with onshore wind, in most countries the cheapest levelised cost of electricity for new installations is utility-scale solar.\n",

      "In particular, with some variations, areas that are closer to the equator generally receive higher amounts of solar radiation than areas that lie further south or farther north.\n",
      "However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow the position of the Sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator.\n",
      "Time variation affects the potential of solar energy, because during the night there is little solar radiation on the surface of the Earth for solar panels to absorb.\n",
      "This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day.\n",
      "Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the Sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.\n",
      "Besides, land availability has a large effect on the available solar energy because solar panels can only be set up on land that is otherwise unused and suitable for solar panels.\n",
      "Roofs are a suitable place for solar cells as many people have discovered that they can collect energy directly from their homes this way.\n",
      "Other areas that are suitable for solar cells are lands that are not being used for businesses, where solar plants can be established.\n",

      "Following the work of Russell Ohl in the 1940s, researchers Gerald Pearson, Calvin Fuller and Daryl Chapin created the silicon solar cell in 1954.\n",
      "These early solar cells cost US$286/watt and reached efficiencies of 4.5–6%.\n",
      "In 1957, Mohamed M. Atalla developed the process of silicon surface passivation by thermal oxidation at Bell Labs.\n",
      "The surface passivation process has since been critical to solar cell efficiency.As of 2022 over 90% of the market is crystalline silicon.\n",
      "The array of a photovoltaic system, or PV system, produces direct current (DC) power which fluctuates with the sunlight's intensity.\n",

      "The Delano family patriarch, Philip Delano, traveled to the New World on the Fortune in 1621, and the Delanos thrived as merchants and shipbuilders in Massachusetts.\n",
      "Roosevelt's father, James, graduated from Harvard Law School in 1851 but chose not to practice law after receiving an inheritance from his grandfather.Franklin had a half-brother, James Roosevelt \"Rosy\" Roosevelt, from his father's previous marriage.\n",
      "James Roosevelt, a prominent Bourbon Democrat, once took Franklin to meet President Grover Cleveland, who said to him: \"My little man, I am making a strange wish for you.\n",
      "It is that you may never be President of the United States.\"\n",
      "Franklin's mother, the dominant influence in his early years, once declared, \"My son Franklin is a Delano, not a Roosevelt at all.\"\n",
      "James, who was 54 when Franklin was born, was considered by some as a remote father, though biographer James MacGregor Burns indicates James interacted with his son more than was typical at the time.\n",
      "As a child, Roosevelt learned to ride, shoot, and sail; he also learned to play polo, tennis, and golf.=== Education and early career ===\n",
      "Frequent trips to Europe—beginning at age two and from age seven to fifteen—helped Roosevelt become conversant in German and French.\n",
      "Except for attending public school in Germany at age nine, Roosevelt was home-schooled by tutors until age 14.\n",
      "He then attended Groton School, an Episcopal boarding school in Groton, Massachusetts.\n",
      "He was not among the more popular Groton students, who were better athletes and had rebellious streaks.\n",
      "Its headmaster, Endicott Peabody, preached the duty of Christians to help the less fortunate and urged his students to enter public service.\n",
      "Like most of his Groton classmates, Roosevelt went to Harvard College.Peabody remained a strong influence throughout Roosevelt's life, officiating at his wedding and visiting him as president.\n",
      "He was a member of the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity and the Fly Club, and served as a school cheerleader.\n",
      "Roosevelt was relatively undistinguished as a student or athlete but he became editor-in-chief of The Harvard Crimson daily newspaper, a position that required ambition, energy and the ability to manage others.\n",
      "He later said, \"I took economics courses in college for four years and everything I was taught was wrong.\n",
      "\"Roosevelt's father died in 1900, causing great distress for him.\n",
      "The following year, Roosevelt's fifth cousin Theodore Roosevelt became President of the United States.\n",

      "Eleanor's father, Elliott, was deceased, and her uncle Theodore, then the president, gave away the bride.\n",
      "The young couple moved into Springwood, and Franklin and Sara Roosevelt also provided a townhouse for the couple in New York City, where Sara built a house alongside for herself.\n",
      "Eleanor never felt at home in the houses at Hyde Park or New York, but she loved the family's vacation home on Campobello Island, which Sara also gave the couple.\n",
      "Burns indicates young Roosevelt was self-assured and at ease in the upper class, while Eleanor was then shy and disliked social life and initially stayed home to raise their children.\n",
      "As his father had, Franklin left the raising of the children to his wife, and Eleanor delegated it to caregivers.\n",
      "She later said she knew \"absolutely nothing about handling or feeding a baby.\"\n",
      "Although Eleanor thought sex was \"an ordeal to be endured\", she and Franklin had six children.\n",

      "Eleanor soon established a separate home in Hyde Park at Val-Kill, and devoted herself to social and political causes independent of her husband.\n",
      "The emotional break in their marriage was so severe that when Franklin asked Eleanor in 1942—in light of his failing health—to come back home and live with him again, she refused.\n"

      "Public-key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is the field of cryptographic systems that use pairs of related keys.\n",
      "Each key pair consists of a public key and a corresponding private key.\n",
      "Key pairs are generated with cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems termed one-way functions.\n",
      "In a public-key encryption system, anyone with a public key can encrypt a message, yielding a ciphertext, but only those who know the corresponding private key can decrypt the ciphertext to obtain the original message.Security of public key cryptography depends on keeping the private key secret; the public key must be openly distributed without compromising security.For example, a journalist can publish the public public key of an encryption key pair on a web site so that sources can send secret messages to\n",
      "Only the journalist who knows the corresponding private key can decrypt the ciphertexts to obtain the sources' messages—an eavesdropper reading email on its way to the journalist cannot decrypt the encrypted messages.\n",
      "However, public-key encryption does not conceal metadata like what computer a source used to send a message, when they sent it, or how long it is.\n",
      "Public-key encryption on its own also does not tell the recipient anything about who sent a message—it just conceals the content of a message in a ciphertext that can only be decrypted with the private key.\n",
      "In a digital signature system, a sender can use a private key together with a message to create a signature.\n",
      "For example, a software publisher can create a signature key pair and include the public key in software installed on computers.Anyone with the corresponding public key can verify whether the signature matches the message, but a forger who does not know the private key cannot find any message/signature pair that will pass verification with the public public key.\n",
      "Later, the publisher can distribute an update to the software signed using the private key, and any computer receiving an update can confirm it is genuine by verifying the signature using the public key.\n",
      "As long as the software publisher keeps the private key secret, even if a forger can distribute malicious updates to computers, they cannot convince the computers that any malicious updates are genuine.\n",
      "Public key algorithms are fundamental security primitives in modern cryptosystems, including applications and protocols which offer assurance of the confidentiality, authenticity and non-repudiability of electronic communications and data storage.\n",
      "They underpin numerous Internet standards, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS), SSH, S/MIME and PGP.\n",
      "Some public key algorithms provide key distribution and secrecy (e. g., Diffie–Hellman key exchange ), some provide digital signatures (e. g., Digital Signature Algorithm ), and some provide both (e.. g., RSA).\n",
      "Asymmetric encryption is rather slower than good symmetric encryption, too slow for many purposes.\n",
      "Today's cryptosystems (such as TLS, Secure Shell ) use both symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption to securely exchange a secret key which is then used for symmetric cryptography.\n",
      "Before the mid-1970s, all cipher systems used symmetric key algorithms, in which the same cryptographic key is used with the underlying algorithm by both the sender and the recipient, who must both keep it secret.== Description ==\n",
      "Of necessity, the key in every such system had to be exchanged between the communicating parties in some secure way prior to any use of the system – for instance, via a secure channel.\n",
      "This requirement is never trivial and very rapidly becomes unmanageable as the number of participants increases or when secure channels are not available or when, (as is sensible cryptographic practice), keys are frequently changed.\n",
      "In particular, if messages are meant to be secure from other users, a separate key is required for each possible pair of users.\n",
      "By contrast, in a public key system, the public keys can be disseminated widely and openly and only the corresponding private keys need be kept secret by its owner.\n",
      "Two of the best-known uses of public key cryptography are: Public key encryption, in which a message is encrypted with the intended recipient's public key.\n",
      "For properly chosen and used algorithms, messages cannot in practice be decrypted by anyone who does not possess the matching private key, who is thus presumed to be the owner of that key and so the person associated with the public key.\n",
      "This can be used to ensure confidentiality of a message.\n",
      "Digital signatures, in which a message is signed with the sender's private key and can be verified by anyone who has access to the sender’s public key.\n",
      "This verification proves that the sender had access to the private key, and therefore is very likely to be the person associated with the public key.\n",
      "One important issue is confidence/proof that a particular public key is authentic, i. e. that the signature was prepared for that exact message, since verification will fail for any other message one could devise without using the private key.It also proves that the signatures were prepared for the exact message.\n",
      "that it is correct and belongs to the person or entity claimed, and has not been tampered with or replaced by some (perhaps malicious) third party.\n",
      "There are several possible approaches, including:A public key infrastructure (PKI), in which one or more third parties – known as certificate authorities – certify ownership of key pairs.\n",
      "TLS relies upon this.\n",
      "This implies that the PKI system (software, hardware and management) is trust-able by all involved.\n",
      "A \"web of trust\" which decentralizes authentication by using individual endorsements of links between a user and the public key belonging to that user.\n",
      "PGP uses this approach to lookup in the domain name system (DNS).\n",
      "The DKIM system for digitally signing emails also uses this approach.\n",
      "The most obvious application of a public key encryption system is for encrypting communication to provide confidentiality – a message that a sender encrypts using the recipient's public key which can be decrypted only by the sender's paired private key.== Applications ==\n",
      "Another application in public key cryptography is the digital signature.\n",
      "Digital signature schemes can be used for sender authentication.\n",
      "Non-repudiation systems use digital signatures to ensure that one party cannot successfully dispute its authorship of a document or communication.\n",
      "Further applications built on this foundation include: digital cash, password-authenticated key agreement, time-stamping services and non-repudiation protocols.\n",
      "Because asymmetric key algorithms are nearly always much more computationally intensive than symmetric ones, it is common to use a public/private asymmetric-exchange algorithm to encrypt and exchange a symmetric key, which is then used by  symmetric-key cryptography to transmit data using the now-shared symmetric public key for a different algorithm.=== Hybrid cryptosystems ===\n",
      "PGP, SSH, and the SSL/TLS family of schemes use this procedure;  they are thus called hybrid cryptosystems.\n",
      "The initial asymmetric cryptography-based key exchange to share a server-generated symmetric key from the server to client has the advantage of not requiring that a pre-shared manually, such as on printed paper or discs transported by a courier, while providing the higher data throughput of symmetric keys over asymmetric key cryptography for the remainder of the shared connection.\n",
      "As with all security-related systems, it is important to identify potential weaknesses.== Weaknesses ==\n",
      "Aside from poor choice of an asymmetric key algorithm (there are few which are widely regarded as satisfactory ) or too short a key length, the chief security risk is that the private key of a pair becomes known\n",
      "All security of messages, authentication, etc., will then be lost.\n",
      "Additionally, with the advent of quantum computing, many asymmetric key algorithms are considered vulnerable to attacks, and new quantum-resistant schemes are being developed to overcome the problem.\n",
      "All public key schemes are in theory susceptible to a \"brute-force key search attack\".\n",
      "However, such an attack is impractical if the amount of computation needed to succeed – termed the \"work factor\" by Claude Shannon – is out of reach of all potential attackers.\n",
      "In many cases, the work factor can be increased by simply choosing a longer key.\n",
      "But other algorithms may inherently have much lower work factors, making resistance to a brute-force attack (e. g., from longer keys) irrelevant.\n",
      "Some special and specific algorithms have been developed to aid in attacking some public key encryption algorithms; both RSA and ElGamal encryption have known attacks that are much faster than the brute-force approach.\n",
      "None of these are sufficiently improved to be actually practical, however.\n",
      "Major weaknesses have been found for several formerly promising asymmetric key algorithms.\n",
      "The \"knapsack packing\" algorithm was found to be insecure after the development of a new attack.\n",
      "As with all cryptographic functions, public-key implementations may be vulnerable to side-channel attacks that exploit information leakage to simplify the search for a secret key.\n",
      "These are often independent of the algorithm being used.\n",
      "Research is underway to both discover, and to protect against, new attacks.\n",
      "Asymmetric keys can be used to provide different public keys instead of the same public key for different applications. This is known as a \"man-in-the-middle\" attack, in which the communication of public keys is intercepted by a third party (the \"man in the middle\") and then modified to provide a different public key instead.\n",
      "Encrypted messages and responses must, in all instances, be intercepted, decrypted and re-encrypted by the attacker using the correct public keys for the different communication segments so as to avoid suspicion.\n"

      "Quantum cryptography is the science of exploiting quantum mechanical properties to perform cryptographic tasks.\n",
      "The best known example of quantum cryptography is quantum key distribution, which offers an information-theoretically secure solution to the key exchange problem.\n",

      "Non-quantum (i. e. non-Quantum) communication.\n",
      "For example, it is impossible to copy data encoded in a quantum state.\n",
      "If one attempts to read the encoded data, the quantum state will be changed due to wave function collapse (no-cloning theorem).\n",
      "This could be used to detect eavesdropping in quantum key distribution (QKD).\n",
      "In the early 1970s, Stephen Wiesner, then at Columbia University in New York, introduced the concept of quantum conjugate coding.\n",
      "His seminal paper titled \"Conjugate Coding\" was rejected by the IEEE Information Theory Society but was eventually published in 1983 in SIGACT News.\n",
      "In this paper he showed how to store or transmit two messages by encoding them in two \"conjugate observables\", such as linear and circular polarization of photons, so that either of but not both properties may be received and decoded.\n",
      "It was not until Charles H. Bennett, of the IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center, and Gilles Brassard met in 1979 at the 20th IEEE Symposium on the Foundations of Computer Science, held in Puerto Rico, that they discovered how to incorporate Wiesner's findings.\n",
      "\"The main breakthrough came when we realized that photons were never meant to store information but rather to transmit it.\"\n",
      "In 1984, building upon this work, Bennett and Brassard proposed a method for secure communication, which is now called BB84.\n",
      "Independently, in 1991 Artur Ekert proposed to use Bell's inequalities to achieve secure key distribution.\n",
      "Ekert's protocol for the key distribution, as it was subsequently shown by Dominic Mayers and Andrew Yao, offers device-independent quantum key distribution.\n",
      "Companies that manufacture quantum cryptography systems include MagiQ Technologies, Inc. (Boston), ID Quantique (Geneva), QuintessenceLabs (Canberra, Australia), Toshiba (Tokyo), QNu Labs (India) and SeQureNet (Paris).\n",
      "Cryptography is the strongest link in the chain of data security.== Advantages ==\n",
      "However, interested parties cannot assume that cryptographic keys will remain secure indefinitely.\n",
      "Quantum cryptography has the potential to encrypt data for longer periods than classical cryptography.\n",
      "Using classical cryptography, scientists cannot guarantee encryption beyond approximately 30 years, but some stakeholders could use longer periods of protection.\n",
      "Take, for example, the healthcare industry.\n",
      "As of 2017, 85.9% of office-based physicians are using electronic medical record systems to store and transmit patient data.\n",
      "Under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, medical records must be kept secret.\n",
      "Quantum key distribution can protect electronic records for periods of up to 100 years.\n",
      "Also, quantum cryptography has useful applications for governments and militaries as, historically, governments have kept military data secret for periods of over 60 years.\n",
      "There also has been proof that quantum key distribution can travel through a noisy channel over a long distance and be secure.\n",
      "It can be reduced from a noisy quantum scheme to a classical noiseless scheme.\n",
      "This can be solved with classical probability theory.\n",
      "This process of having consistent protection over a noisy channel can be possible through the implementation of quantum repeaters.\n",
      "Quantum repeaters have the ability to resolve quantum communication errors in an efficient way.\n",
      "Quantum repeaters, which are quantum computers, can be stationed as segments over the noisy channel to ensure the security of communication.\n",
      "Quantum repeaters do this by purifying the segments of the channel before connecting them creating a secure line of communication.\n",
      "Sub-par quantum repeaters can provide an efficient amount of security through the noisy channel over a long distance.\n",
      "Quantum cryptography is a general subject that covers a broad range of cryptographic practices and protocols.== Applications ==\n",
      "Some of the most notable applications and protocols are discussed below.\n",
      "The best-known and developed application of quantum cryptography is QKD, which is the process of using quantum communication to establish a shared key between two parties (Alice and Bob, for example) without a third party (Eve) learning anything about that key, even if Eve can eavesdrop on all communication between Alice and Bob.=== Quantum key distribution ===\n",
      "If Eve tries to learn information about the key being established, discrepancies will arise causing Alice and Bob to notice.\n",
      "Once the key is established, it is then typically used for encrypted communication using classical techniques.\n",
      "For instance, the exchanged key could be used for symmetric cryptography (e. g.\n",
      "one-time pad).\n",
      "The security of quantum key distribution can be proven mathematically without imposing any restrictions on the abilities of an eavesdropper, something not possible with classical key distribution.\n",
      "This is usually described as \"unconditional security\", although there are some minimal assumptions required, including that the laws of quantum mechanics apply and that Alice and Bob are able to authenticate each other, i. e.\n",
      "Eve should not be able to impersonate Alice or Bob as otherwise a man-in-the-middle attack would be possible.\n",
      "While QKD is secure, its practical application faces some challenges.\n",
      "There are in fact limitations for the key generation rate at increasing transmission distances.\n",
      "Recent studies have allowed important advancements in this regard.\n",
      "In 2018, the protocol of twin-field QKD was proposed as a mechanism to overcome the limits of lossy communication.\n",
      "The rate of the twin field protocol was shown to overcome the secret key-agreement capacity of the lossy communication channel, known as repeater-less PLOB bound, at 340 km of optical fiber; its ideal rate surpasses this bound already at 200 km and follows the rate-loss scaling of the higher repeater assisted secret key agreement capacity (see figure 1 of and figure 11 of for more details).\n",
      "The protocol suggests that optimal key rates are achievable on \"550 kilometers of standard optical fibre\", which is already commonly used in communications today.\n",
      "The theoretical result was confirmed in the first experimental demonstration of QKD beyond the PLOB bound which has been characterized as the first effective quantum repeater.\n",
      "Notable developments in terms of achieving high rates at long distances are the sending-not-sending (SNS) version of the TF-QKD protocol.\n",
      "and the no-phase-postselected twin-field scheme.\n",
      "In mistrustful cryptography the participating parties do not trust each other.=== Mistrustful quantum cryptography ===\n",
      "For example, Alice and Bob collaborate to perform some computation where both parties enter some private inputs.\n",
      "But Alice does not trust Bob and Bob does NOT trust Alice.\n",
      "A secure implementation of a cryptographic task requires that after completing the computation, Alice can be guaranteed that Bob has not cheated and Bob can be sure that Alice has not cheated either.\n",
      "Examples of tasks in mistrustful cryptography are commitment schemes and secure computations, the latter including the further examples of coin flipping and oblivious transfer.\n",
      "Key distribution does not belong to the area of mistrustful cryptography.\n",
      "Mistrustful quantum cryptography studies the area of mistrustful cryptography using quantum systems.\n",
      "In contrast to quantum key distribution where unconditional security can be achieved based only on the laws of quantum physics, in the case of various tasks in mistrustful cryptography there are no-go theorems showing that it is impossible to achieve unconditionally secure protocols based on the principles of classical cryptography.\n",
      "However, some of these tasks can be implemented with unconditional security if the protocols not only exploit quantum mechanics but also special relativity.\n",
      "For example, unconditionally secure quantum bit commitment was shown impossible by Mayers and by Lo and Chau.\n",
      "Unconditionally secure ideal quantum coin flipping was shown impossible by Lo and Chau.\n",
      "Moreover, Lo showed that there cannot be unconditionally secure quantum protocols for one-out-of-two oblivious transfer and other secure two-party computations.\n",
      "However, unconditionally secure relativistic protocols for coin flipping and bit-commitment have been shown by Kent.\n",
      "Unlike quantum key distribution, quantum coin flipping is a protocol that is used between two participants who do not trust each other.==== Quantum coin flipping ====\n",
      "The participants communicate via a quantum channel and exchange information through the transmission of qubits.\n",
      "But because Alice and Bob do not trust each other, each expects the other to cheat.\n",
      "Therefore, more effort must be spent on ensuring that neither Alice nor Bob can gain a significant advantage over the other to produce a desired outcome.\n",
      "An ability to influence a particular outcome is referred to as a bias and there is a significant focus on developing protocols to reduce the bias of a dishonest player, otherwise known as cheating.\n",
      "Quantum communication protocols have been shown to provide significant security advantages over classical communication, though they may be considered difficult to realize in the practical world.A coin flip protocol generally occurs like this:Alice chooses a basis (either rectilinear or diagonal) and generates a string of photons to send to Bob in that basis.\n",
      "Bob randomly chooses to measure each photon in a rectilinear or diagonal basis, noting which basis he used and the measured value.\n",
      "Bob publicly guesses which basis Alice used to send her qubits.\n"

      "A credit report is a record of the borrower's credit history from a number of sources, including banks, credit card companies, collection agencies, and governments.\n",
      "A borrower's credit score is the result of a mathematical algorithm applied to a credit report and other sources of information to predict future delinquency.In many countries, when a customer submits an application for credit from a bank, credit card company or a store, their information is forwarded to a consumer credit bureau.In many cases, the information is also forwarded to the credit bureau for further analysis.\n",
      "The credit bureau matches the name, address and other identifying information on the credit applicant with information retained by the bureau in its files.\n",
      "The gathered records are then used by lenders to determine an individual's credit worthiness; that is, determining the ability and track record of repaying a debt.\n",
      "The willingness to repay a debt is indicated by how timely past payments have been made to other lenders.\n",
      "Lenders like to see consumer debt obligations paid regularly and on time, and therefore focus particularly on missed payments and may not consider an overpayment as an offset for a missed payment.\n",
      "There has been much discussion over the accuracy of the data in consumer reports.== Credit history usage ==\n",
      "In general, industry participants maintain that the data in credit reports is very accurate.\n",
      "The credit bureaus point to their own study of 52 million credit reports to highlight that the data in reports is very accurate.\n",
      "The Consumer Data Industry Association testified before the United States Congress that less than two percent of those reports that resulted in a consumer dispute had data deleted because it was in error.\n",
      "Nonetheless, there is widespread concern that information in credit reports is prone to error.\n",
      "Thus Congress has enacted a series of laws aimed to resolve both the errors and the perception of errors.\n",
      "If a US consumer disputes some information in a credit report, the credit bureau has 30 days to verify the data.\n",
      "Over 70 percent of these consumer disputes are resolved within 14 days and then the consumer is notified of the resolution.\n",
      "The Federal Trade Commission states that 95 percent of those who dispute an item seem satisfied with the outcome.The other factor in determining whether a lender will provide a consumer credit or a loan is dependent on income.\n",
      "The higher the income, all other things being equal, the more credit the consumer can access.\n",
      "Lenders make credit granting decisions based on both ability to repay a debt (income) and willingness (the credit report) as indicated by a history of regular, unmissed payments.\n",
      "These factors help lenders determine whether to extend credit, and on what terms.\n",
      "With the adoption of risk-based pricing on almost all lending in the financial services industry, this report has become even more important since it is usually the sole element used to choose the annual percentage rate (APR), grace period and other contractual obligations of the credit card or loan.\n",
      "Credit scores vary from one scoring model to another, but in general the FICO scoring system is the standard in U.S., Canada and other global areas.== Calculating a credit score ==\n",
      "The factors are similar and may include:Payment history (35% contribution on the FICO scale): A record of negative information can lower a consumer's credit rating or score.\n",
      "In general risk scoring systems look for any of the following negative events; charge offs, collections, late payments, repossessions, foreclosures, settlements, bankruptcies, liens, and judgements.\n",
      "Within this category, FICO considers the severity of the negative item, the age and the prevalence of negative items and the frequency of negative item occurrence.\n",
      "Newer unpaid or delinquent debt is considered worse than older unpaid and delinquent debts.\n",
      "More severe is worse than less severe.\n",
      "And, many is worse than few.\n",
      "Debt (30% contribution on the FICO score): This category considers the amount and type of debt carried by a consumer as reflected on their credit reports.\n",
      "The amount of debt you have divided by your total credit limit is called the credit utilization ratio.\n",
      "There are three types of debt considered in this calculation.\n",
      "Revolving debt: This is credit card debt, retail card debt and some petroleum cards.\n",
      "And while home equity lines of credit have revolving terms the bulk of debt considered is true unsecured revolving debt incurred on plastic.\n",
      "The most important measurement from this category is called \"Revolving Utilization\", which is the relationship between the consumer's aggregate credit card balances and the available credit card limits, also called \"open to buy\".\n",
      "This is expressed as a percentage and is calculated by dividing the aggregate credit card balances by the aggregate aggregate credit limits and multiplying the result by 100, thus yielding the utilization percentage.\n",
      "The higher that percentage, the lower the cardholder's score will likely be.\n",
      "This is why closing credit cards is generally not a good idea for someone trying to improve their credit scores.\n",
      "Closing one or more credit card accounts will reduce their total available credit limits and likely increase the utilization percentage unless the cardholder reduces their balances at the same pace.\n",
      "Installment debt: This is debt where there is a fixed payment for a fixed period of time.\n",
      "An auto loan is a good example as the cardholder is generally making the same payment for 36, 48, or 60 months.\n",
      "While installment debt is considered in risk scoring systems, it is a distant second in its importance behind the revolving credit card debt.\n",
      "Installment debt is generally secured by an asset like a car, home, or boat.\n",
      "As such, consumers will use extraordinary efforts to make their payments so their asset is not repossessed by the lender for non-payment.\n",
      "Open debt: This is the least common type of debt.\n",
      "This is debt that must be paid in full each month.\n",
      "An example is any one of the variety of charge cards that are \"pay in full\" products.\n",
      "The American Express Green card is a common example.\n",
      "Open debt is treated like revolving credit card debt in older versions of the FICO scoring system but is excluded from the revolving utilization calculation in newer versions.\n",
      "Time in file (Credit File Age) (15% contribution on the FICO scale): The older the cardholder's credit report, the more stable it is in general.\n",
      "As such, their score should benefit from an old credit report.\n",
      "This \"age\" is determined two ways; the age of the cardholder's credit file and the average age of accounts on their credit file.\n",
      "The age of their credit file is determined by the oldest account's \"date opened\", which sets the age of the credit file.\n",
      "The average age is set by averaging the age of every account on the credit report, whether open or closed.\n",
      "Account Diversity (10% contribution on the FICO scale): A cardholder's credit score will benefit by having a diverse set of account types on their credit file.\n",
      "Having experience across multiple account types (installment, revolving, auto, mortgage, cards, etc.)\n",
      "is generally a good thing for their scores because they are proving the ability to manage different account types.\n",
      "The Search for a New Credit (Credit inquiries) (10% contribution on the FICO scale): An inquiry is noted every time a company requests some information from a consumer's credit file.\n",
      "There are several kinds of inquiries that may or may not affect one's credit score.\n",
      "Inquiries that have no effect on the creditworthiness of a consumer (also known as \"soft inquiries\"), which remain on a consumer's credit reports for 6 months and are never visible to lenders or credit scoring models, are:Prescreening inquiries where a credit bureau may sell a person's contact information to an institution that issues credit cards, loans and insurance based on certain criteria that the lender has established.\n",
      "A creditor also checks its customers' credit files periodically.\n",
      "This is referred to as Account Management, Account Maintenance or Account Review.\n",
      "A credit counseling agency, with the client's permission, can obtain a client's credit report with no adverse action.\n",
      "A consumer can check his or her own credit report without impacting creditworthiness.\n",
      "This is referred to as a \"consumer disclosure\" inquiry.\n",
      "Inquiries that can have an effect on the creditworthiness of a consumer and are visible to lenders and credit scoring models (also known as \"hard inquiries\") are made by lenders when consumers are seeking credit or a loan, in connection with permissible purpose.Employment screening inquiriesInsurance related inquiriesUtility related inquiries\n",
      "Lenders, when granted a permissible purpose, as defined by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, can \"pull\" a consumer file for the purposes of extending credit to a consumer.\n",
      "Hard inquiries can, but do not always, affect the borrower's credit score.\n",
      "Keeping credit inquiries to a minimum can help a person's credit rating.\n",
      "A lender may perceive many inquiries over a short period of time on a person's report as a signal that the person is in financial difficulty, and may consider that person a poor credit risk.\n",
      "Consumers can typically check their credit history by requesting credit reports from credit agencies and demanding correction of information if necessary.== Acquiring and understanding credit reports and scores ==\n",
      "In the United States, the Fair Credit Reporting Act governs businesses that compile credit reports.\n",

      "One-day cricket is a version of the sport of cricket in which a match is generally completed in one day.Limited overs cricket is also known as white ball cricket\n",
      "There are a number of formats of cricket, including List A cricket (8-hour games), Twenty20 cricket (3-year games), and 100-ball cricket (2.5 hours).\n",
      "The name reflects the rule that in the match each team bowls a set maximum number of overs (sets of 6 legal balls), usually between 20 and 50, although shorter and longer forms of limited overs cricket have been played.\n",
      "The concept contrasts with Test and first-class matches, which can take up to five days to complete.\n",
      "One-day cricket is popular with spectators as it can encourage aggressive, risky, entertaining batting, often results in cliffhanger endings, and ensures that a spectator can watch an entire match without committing to five days of continuous attendance.\n",
      "Each team bats only once and each innings is limited to a set number of overs, usually fifty in a One Day International and between forty and sixty in a List A.== Structure ==\n",
      "List A is a classification of the limited-overs (one-day) form of cricket, technically as the domestic level.\n",
      "Despite its name, important one-day matches, international and domestic, often have two days set aside to allow more chance of the game being completed if a result is not possible on the first day (for instance if play is prevented or interrupted by rain).\n",
      "In some tied limited-overs games, a Super Over is played, wherein each team bats for a one-over innings with two wickets in hand.=== Tiebreaker === Super Over ===\n",
      "A tied Super Over may be followed by another Super Over.\n",
      "In almost all competitive one-day games, a restriction is placed on the number of overs that may be bowled by any one bowler.=== Player restrictions === ==== Bowling restrictions ====\n",
      "This is to prevent a side playing two top-class bowlers with extremely good stamina who can bowl throughout their opponents' innings.\n",
      "The usual limitation is set so that a side must include at least five players who bowl i. e.\n",
      "Each bowler can only bowl 20% of the overs.\n",
      "For example, the usual limit for twenty-over cricket is four overs per bowler, for forty-over and for fifty-over matches eight overs per wicket-keeper and for sixty-one overs per batsman respectively.\n",
      "There are exceptions: Pro Cricket in the United States restricted bowlers to five overs each, thus leaving a side requiring only four bowlers.\n",
      "Limited over cricket is usually played with white balls rather than the traditional red balls.==== Fielding restrictions ==== Red balls === White balls ===\n",
      "This was introduced because the team batting second is likely to need to play under floodlights and a white ball is easier to see under these conditions.\n",
      "The white balls are supposed to be otherwise identical to traditional balls, but according to BBC Sport, some cricketers claim that the harder surface causes white balls to swing more.\n",
      "The idea for a one-day, limited 50-over cricket tournament was first played in the inaugural match of the All India Pooja Cricket Tournament in 1951 at Tripunithura in Kochi, Kerala.== History ==\n",
      "It is thought to be the brain child of KV Kelappan Thampuran, a former cricketer and the first Secretary of the Kerala Cricket Association.\n",
      "The first limited-overs tournament between first-class English teams was the Midlands Knock-Out Cup, which took place in May 1962.\n",
      "Played with 65-over innings, the Cup was organised by Mike Turner, secretary of the Leicestershire County Cricket Club.\n",
      "The competition was small, with three other county teams participating in addition to Leicestershire.\n",
      "The following year, the first full-scale one-day competition between first-class teams was played, the knock-out Gillette Cup, won by Sussex.However, it drew commercial television coverage and positive commentary by journalists, who noted the potential to attract sponsors and spectators amid declining attendance levels.\n",
      "The number of overs was reduced to 60 for the 1964 season.\n",
      "League one-day cricket also began in England when the John Player Sunday League was started in 1969 with 40-over matches.\n",
      "Both these competitions have continued every season since inauguration, though the sponsorship has changed.\n",
      "There is now one 50-over competition, which is called the Royal London One-Day Cup.\n",
      "The first Limited Overs International (LOI) or One-Day International (ODI) match was played between Australia and England in Melbourne on 5 January 1971 and the quadrennial cricket World Cup began in 1975.\n",
      "Many of the \"packaging\" innovations, such as coloured clothing, were as a result of World Series Cricket, a \"rebel\" series set up outside the cricketing establishment by Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer.\n",
      "For more details, see History of cricket.\n",
      "Twenty20, a curtailed form of one-day cricket with 20 overs (120 legal balls) per side, was first played in England in 2003.\n",
      "It has proven very popular, and several Twenty20 matches have been played between national teams.\n",
      "It makes several changes to the usual laws of cricket, including the use of a Super Over (one or more additional overs played by each team) to decide the result of tied matches.\n",
      "100-ball cricket (2.5-hour games), another form of one-day cricket with 100 deliveries per side, launched in England in 2021.\n",
      "It is designed to further shorten game time and to attract a new audience.\n",
      "It makes further changes to the usual laws of cricket, such as the involvement of overs that last 5 balls each.\n",
      "There are now also T10 leagues with a format of 10 overs per side (resulting in 90-minute games).\n",
      "The Emirates Cricket Board also launched Ninety–90 Bash, an upcoming annual franchise-based 90-ball cricket league in the United Arab Emirates.\n",
      "One Day International matches are usually played in brightly coloured clothing often in a \"day-night\" format where the first innings of the day occurs in the afternoon and the second occurs under stadium lights.== One Day Internationals ==\n",
      "In the early days of ODI cricket, the number of overs was generally 60 overs per side and matches were also played with 40, 45 or 55 overs per sides but now it has been uniformly fixed at 50 overs.=== One Day International tournaments ===\n",
      "Every four years, the Cricket World Cup involves all the Test-playing nations and other national sides who qualify through the ICC World Cup Qualifier.\n",
      "It usually consists of round-robin stages, followed by semi-finals and a final.\n",
      "The International Cricket Council (ICC) determines the venue far in advance.\n",
      "The ICC Champions Trophy involves all the Test-playing nations, and is held between World Cups.\n",
      "It usually consists of a round-robin group stage, semifinals, and a final.\n",
      "Each Test-playing country often hosts triangular tournaments between the host nation and two touring sides.\n",
      "There is usually a round-robin group, and then the leading two teams play each other in a final, or sometimes a best-of-three final.\n",
      "When there is only one touring side, there is still often a best-of-five series of limited overs matches.\n",
      "The ICC World Cricket League is an ODI competition for national teams with Associate or Affiliate status.\n",
      "List A cricket is a classification of the limited-overs (one-day) form of the sport of cricket.== List A status == List A cricket\n",
      "Much as domestic first-class cricket is the level below international Test match cricket, so List A Cricket is the domestic level of one-day cricket below One Day Internationals.\n",
      "Twenty20 matches do not qualify for the present.\n",
      "Most cricketing nations have some form of domestic List A competition.\n",
      "The number of overs in List A cricket ranges from forty to sixty overs per side.\n",
      "The Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians created this category for the purpose of providing an equivalent to first-class cricket, to allow the generation of career records and statistics for comparable one-day matches.\n",
      "Only the more important one-day competitions in each country, plus matches against a touring Test team, are included.\n",
      "The categorisation of cricket matches as \"List A\" was not officially endorsed by the International Cricket Council until 2006, when the ICC announced that it and its member associations would be determining this classification in a manner similar to that done for first class matches.Matches that qualify as List A:One Day Internationals (ODIs )Other international matches (including World Cup warm-up matches )Other Tourist matches (for example, against first-class teams that are not part of the\n",

      "That surpassed the 443 for nine by Sri Lanka against the Netherlands in their One Day International 50-overs match at Amstelveen on 4 July 2006, which was the record ODI score at the time.\n",
      "On 19 June 2018, England set a new international record, totalling 481 for 6 against Australia at Trent Bridge.\n",
      "The lowest ever total is 23 by Yorkshire against Middlesex at Headingley in 1974 in a 40-overs match.\n",
      "The record low score in ODIs was set by Zimbabwe, who managed just 35 against Sri Lanka in Harare on 25 April 2004.\n"

      "Solar-cell efficiency refers to the portion of energy in the form of sunlight that can be converted via photovoltaics into electricity by the solar cell.\n",
      "The efficiency of the solar cells used in a photovoltaic system determines the annual energy output of the system.\n",
      "For example, a solar panel with 20% efficiency and an area of 1 m2 will produce 200 kWh/yr at Standard Test Conditions if exposed to the Standard Test Condition solar irradiance value of 1000 W/m2 for 2.74 hours a day.\n",
      "Usually solar panels are exposed to sunlight for longer than this in a given day, but the solar irradiance is less than 1000 W/m2 for most of the day.\n",
      "A solar panel can produce more when the sun is high in the sky and will produce less in cloudy conditions or when it is low in the sun's path. The sun is lower in the air in the winter and higher in the summer.\n",
      "Two location dependant factors that affect solar PV yield are the dispersion and intensity of solar radiation.\n",
      "These two variables can vary greatly between each country.\n",
      "The global regions that have high radiation levels throughout the year are the middle east, Northern Chile, Australia, China, and Southwestern USA.\n",
      "In a high-yield solar area like central Colorado, which receives annual insolation of 2000 kWh/m2/year, a panel can be expected to produce 400 kWh of energy per year.\n",
      "However, in Michigan, which receives only 1400 kWh/m2/year, annual energy yield will drop to 280 kWh for the same panel.\n",
      "At more northerly European latitudes, yields are significantly lower: 175 kWh annual energy yield in southern England under the same conditions.\n",
      "Several factors affect a cell's conversion efficiency, including its reflectance, thermodynamic efficiency, charge carrier separation efficiency, charge carrier collection efficiency and conduction efficiency values.\n",
      "Because these parameters can be difficult to measure directly, other parameters are measured instead, including quantum efficiency, open-circuit voltage (VOC) ratio, and § Fill factor.\n",
      "Reflectance losses are accounted for by the quantum efficiency value as they affect \"external quantum efficiency\".\n",
      "Recombination losses are accounted for by the quantum efficiency, VOC ratio, and fill factor values.\n",
      "Resistive losses are predominantly accounted for by the fill factor value but also contribute to the quantum efficiency and VOC ratio values.\n",
      "As of 2022, the world record for solar cell efficiency is 47.1%, set in 2019 by multi-junction concentrator solar cells developed at National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), Golden, Colorado, USA.\n",
      "This record was set in lab conditions, under extremely concentrated light.\n",
      "The record in real-world conditions is also held by NREL, who developed triple junction cells with a tested efficiency of 39.5%.\n",
      "The factors affecting energy conversion efficiency were expounded in a landmark paper by William Shockley and Hans Queisser in 1961.== Factors affecting energy efficiency ==\n",
      "See Shockley–Queisser limit for more detail.\n",
      "If one has a source of heat at temperature Ts and cooler heat sink at temperature Tc, the maximum theoretically possible value for the ratio of work (or electric power) obtained to heat supplied is 1-Tc/Ts, given by a Carnot heat engine.=== Thermodynamic-efficiency limit and infinite-stack limit ===\n",
      "If we take 6000 K for the temperature of the sun and 300 K for ambient conditions on earth, this comes to 95%.\n",
      "In 1981, Alexis de Vos and Herman Pauwels showed that this is achievable with a stack of infinite number of cells with band gaps ranging from infinity (the first cells encountered by the incoming photons) to zero, with a voltage in each cell very close to the open-circuit voltage, equal to 95% of the band gap of that cell, and with 6000 K blackbody radiation coming from all directions.\n",
      "The efficiency of the stack is 95% of the net amount of light absorbed – the stack emits radiation as it has non-zero temperature, and this radiation has to be subtracted from the incoming radiation when calculating the amount of heat being transferred and the efficiency.However, the 95% efficiency thereby achieved means that the electric power produced is only 95% as much as the light absorbed by the stack.\n",
      "The authors considered the more relevant problem of maximizing the power output for a stack being illuminated from all directions by 6000 K blackbody radiation.\n",
      "In this case, the voltages must be lowered to less than 95% of the band gap (the percentage is not constant over all the cells).\n",
      "The maximum theoretical efficiency calculated is 86.8% for a stack of an infinite number of cells, using the incoming concentrated sunlight radiation.\n",
      "When the incoming radiation comes only from an area of the sky the size of the sun, the efficiency limit drops to 68.7%.\n",
      "Normal photovoltaic systems however have only one p–n junction and are therefore subject to a lower efficiency limit, called the \"ultimate efficiency\" by Shockley and Queisser.=== Ultimate efficiency ===\n",
      "Photons with an energy below the band gap of the absorber material cannot generate an electron-hole pair, so their energy is not converted to useful output and only generates heat if absorbed.\n",
      "For photons with an energy above the band gap energy, only a fraction of the energy can be converted to useful output.\n",
      "When a photon of greater energy is absorbed, the excess energy above the band gap is converted to kinetic energy of the carrier combination.\n",
      "The excess kinetic energy is converted to heat through phonon interactions as the kinetic energy of the carriers slows to equilibrium velocity.\n",
      "Traditional single-junction cells with an optimal band gap for the solar spectrum have a maximum theoretical efficiency of 33.16%, the Shockley–Queisser limit.Solar cells with multiple band gap absorber materials improve efficiency by dividing the sun spectrum into smaller bins where the thermodynamic efficiency limit is higher for each bin.\n",
      "As described above, when a photon is absorbed by a solar cell it can produce an electron-hole pair.=== Quantum efficiency ===\n",
      "One of the carriers may reach the p–n junction and contribute to the current produced by the solar cell; such a carrier is said to be collected.\n",
      "Or, the carriers recombine with no net contribution to cell current.\n",
      "Quantum efficiency refers to the percentage of photons that are converted to electric current (i. e., collected carriers ) when the cell is operated under short circuit conditions.\n",
      "There are two types of quantum that are usually referred to when talking about solar cells.\n",
      "The external quantum efficiency is the external measurable properties of the solar cell.\n",
      "The \"external\" quantum efficiency of a silicon solar cell includes the effect of optical losses such as transmission and reflection.\n",
      "In particular, some measures can be taken to reduce these losses.\n",
      "The second type is the internal quantum efficiency, this measurement gives a deeper insight of the internal material parameters like the absorption coefficient or internal luminescence quantum efficiency.The reflection losses, which can account for up to 10% of the total incident energy, can be dramatically decreased using a technique called texturization, a light trapping method that modifies the average light path.\n",
      "The internal quantum efficiency is mainly used when it comes to the understanding of the potential of a certain material rather than a device.Quantum efficiency is most usefully expressed as a spectral measurement (that is, as a function of photon wavelength or energy).\n",
      "Since some wavelengths are absorbed more effectively than others, spectral measurements of quantum efficiency can yield valuable information about the quality of the semiconductor bulk and surfaces.\n",
      "However, the quantum efficiency alone is not the same as overall energy conversion efficiency as it does not convey information about the fraction of power that is converted by the solar cell.\n",
      "A solar cell may operate over a wide range of voltages (V) and currents (I).\n",
      "By increasing the resistive load on an irradiated cell continuously from zero (a short circuit ) to a very high value (an open circuit ) one can determine the maximum power point, the point that maximizes V×I; that is, the load for which the cell can deliver maximum electrical power at that level of irradiation.\n",
      "(The output power is zero in both the short circuit and open circuit extremes).\n",
      "The maximum power point of a solar cell is affected by its temperature.\n",
      "Knowing the technical data of certain solar cell, its power output at a certain temperature can be obtained by obtaining the power generated at the standard testing condition. The power generated by a solar cell at a given temperature is known as the power output of the cell at the testing condition; the power produced at the test condition is called the “power generated”, where  \n",
      "A high quality, monocrystalline silicon solar cell, at 25 °C cell temperature, may produce 0.60 V open-circuit (VOC ).\n",
      "The cell temperature in full sunlight, even with 25 °C air temperature, will probably be close to 45 °C, reducing the open-circuit voltage to 0.55 V per cell.\n"

      "In social science and politics, power is the social production of an effect that determines the capacities, actions, beliefs, or conduct of actors.\n",
      "Power does not exclusively refer to the threat or use of force (coercion) by one actor against another but may also be exerted through diffuse means (such as institutions).\n",
      "Power may also take structural forms as it orders actors in relation to one another (such as distinguishing between a master and an enslaved person, a householder and their relatives, an employer and their employees, a parent and a child, a political representative and their voters ).\n",
      "The term authority is often used for power that is perceived as legitimate or socially approved by the social structure.It can be used to refer to some behaviors and groups over others ( e. g. ), categories and language, and discursive forms, as categories or language may lend legitimacy to certain behaviors and group over others.\n",
      "Power can be seen as evil or unjust; however, power can also be good and as something inherited or given for exercising humanistic objectives that will help others as well.\n",
      "Scholars have distinguished the differences between soft power and hard power.\n",
      "In a now-classic study (1959), social psychologists John R. P. French and Bertram Raven developed a schema of sources of power by which to analyse how power plays work (or fail to work) in a specific relationship.== Theories ===== Five bases of power ===\n",
      "According to French and Raven, power must be distinguished from influence in the following way: power is that state of affairs that holds in a given relationship, A-B, such that a given influence attempt by A over B makes A's desired change in B more likely.\n",
      "Conceived this way, power is fundamentally relative; it depends on the specific understandings A and B each apply to their relationship and requires B's recognition of a quality in A that would motivate B to change in the way A intends.\n",
      "A must draw on the 'base' or combination of bases of power appropriate to the relationship to effect the desired outcome.\n",
      "Drawing on the wrong power base can have unintended effects, including a reduction in A's own power.\n",
      "French and Raven argue that there are five significant categories of such qualities, while not excluding other minor categories.\n",
      "Further bases have since been adduced, in particular by Gareth Morgan in his 1986 book, Images of Organization.\n",
      "Legitimate power is the power of an individual because of the relative position and duties of the holder of the position within an organization.Also called \"positional power\", legitimate power is a power that an individual has because of their relative position within the organization.\n",
      "Legitimate power is formal authority delegated to the holder of the position.\n",
      "It is usually accompanied by various attributes of power, such as a uniform, a title, or an imposing physical office.\n",
      "In simple terms, power can be expressed as being upward or downward.\n",
      "With downward power, a company's superiors influence subordinates to attain organizational goals.\n",
      "When a company exhibits upward power, subordinates influence the decisions of their leader or leaders.\n",
      "Referent power is the power or ability of individuals to attract others and build loyalty.==== Referent power ====\n",
      "It is based on the charisma and interpersonal skills of the powerholder.\n",
      "A person may be admired because of a specific personal trait, and this admiration creates the opportunity for interpersonal influence.\n",
      "Here, the person under power desires to identify with these personal qualities and gains satisfaction from being an accepted follower.\n",
      "Nationalism and patriotism count towards an intangible sort of referent power.\n",
      "For example, soldiers fight in wars to defend the honor of the country.\n",
      "This is the second-least obvious power but the most effective.\n",
      "Advertisers have long used the referent power of sports figures for product endorsements, for example.\n",
      "The charismatic appeal of the sports star supposedly leads to an acceptance of the endorsement, although the individual may have little real credibility outside the sports arena.\n",
      "Abuse is possible when someone who is likable yet lacks integrity and honesty rises to power, placing them in a situation to gain personal advantage at the cost of the group's position.\n",
      "Referent power is unstable alone and is not enough for a leader who wants longevity and respect.\n",
      "When combined with other sources of power, however, it can help a person achieve great success.\n",
      "Expert power is an individual's power deriving from the skills or expertise of the person and the organization's needs for those skills and expertise.==== Expert power ====\n",
      "Unlike the others, this type of power is usually highly specific and limited to the particular area in which the expert is trained and qualified.\n",
      "When they have knowledge and skills that enable them to understand a situation, suggest solutions, use solid judgment and generally outperform others, then people tend to listen to them.\n",
      "When individuals demonstrate expertise, people tend to trust them and respect what they say.\n",
      "As subject-matter experts, their ideas will have more value, and others will look to them for leadership in that area.\n",
      "Reward power depends on the ability of the power wielder to confer valued material rewards; it refers to the degree to which the individual can give others a reward of some kind, such as benefits, time off, desired gifts, promotions, or increases in pay or responsibility.==== Reward power ==== Reward power is\n",
      "This power is obvious, but it is also ineffective if abused.\n",
      "People who abuse their power can become pushy or be reprimanded for being too forthcoming or'moving things too quickly'.\n",
      "If others expect to be rewarded for doing what someone wants, there is a high probability that they will do it.\n",
      "The problem with this basis of power is that the rewarder may not have as much control over rewards as may be required.\n",
      "Supervisors rarely have complete control over salary increases and managers often cannot control all actions in isolation; even a company CEO needs permission from the board of directors for some actions.\n",
      "When an individual uses up available rewards or the rewards do not have enough perceived value for others, their power weakens.\n",
      "One of the frustrations of using rewards is that they often need to be bigger each time if they are to have the same motivational impact.\n",
      "Even then, if rewards are given frequently, people can become so satiated by the reward it loses its effectiveness.\n",
      "In terms of cancel culture, the mass ostracization used to reconcile unchecked injustice and abuse of power is an \"upward power.\"\n",
      "Policies for policing the internet against these processes as a pathway for creating due process for handling conflicts, abuses and harm that is done through established processes are known as \"downward power.\"\n",
      "Coercive power is the application of negative influences.==== Coercive Power ====\n",
      "It includes the ability to defer or withhold other rewards.\n",
      "The desire for valued rewards or the fear of having them withheld can ensure the obedience of those under power.\n",
      "Coercive power tends to be the most obvious but least effective form of power as it builds resentment and resistance from the people who experience it.\n",
      "Threats and punishment are common tools of coercion.\n",
      "Implying or threatening that someone will be fired, demoted, denied privileges or given undesirable assignments – these are characteristics of using coercive power.\n",
      "Extensive use of coercive power is rarely appropriate in an organizational setting and relying on these forms of power alone will result in a very cold, impoverished style of leadership.\n",
      "This is a type of power commonly seen in the fashion industry by coupling with legitimate power; it is referred to in the industry-specific literature as \"glamorization of structural domination and exploitation\".\n",
      "Power as a perception: Power is a perception in the sense that some people can have objective power but still have trouble influencing others.=== Principles in interpersonal relationships ===According to Laura K. Guerrero and Peter A. Andersen in Close Encounters: Communication in Relationships:\n",
      "People who use power cues and act powerfully and proactively tend to be perceived as powerful by others.\n",
      "Some people become influential even though they don't overtly use powerful behavior.\n",
      "Power as a relational concept: Power exists in relationships.\n",
      "The issue here is often how much relative power a person has in comparison to one's partner.\n",
      "Partners in close and satisfying relationships often influence each other at different times in various arenas.\n",
      "Power as resource-based: Power usually represents a struggle over resources.\n",
      "The more scarce and valued resources are, the more intense and protracted the power struggles.\n",
      "The scarcity hypothesis indicates that people have the most power when the resources they possess are hard to come by or are in high demand.\n",
      "However, scarce resources lead to power only if they are valued within a relationship.\n",
      "The principle of least interest and dependence power: The person with less to lose has greater power in the relationship.\n",
      "Dependence power indicates that those who are dependent on their relationship or partner are less powerful, especially if they know their partner is uncommitted and might leave them.\n",
      "According to interdependence theory, the quality of alternatives refers to the types of relationships and opportunities people could have if they were not in their current relationship.\n",

      "The Deutsch–Jozsa algorithm is a deterministic quantum algorithm proposed by David Deutsch and Richard Jozsa in 1992 with improvements by Richard Cleve, Artur Ekert, Chiara Macchiavello and Michele Mosca in 1998.\n",
      "Although of little practical use, it is one of the first examples of a quantum algorithm that is exponentially faster than any possible deterministic classical algorithm.The Deutsch–Jozsa problem is specifically designed to be easy for a classical algorithm and hard for any deterministic quantum algorithm.\n",
      "It is a black box problem that can be solved efficiently by a quantum computer with no error, whereas a classical computer would need a exponential number of queries to the black box to solve the problem.\n",
      "Since the problem is easy to solve on a probabilistic classical computer, it does not yield an oracle separation with BPP, the class of problems that can be solved with bounded error in polynomial time on a classical computer.More formally, it yields a oracle relative to which EQP and P are different.\n",
      "Simon's problem is an example of a problem that yields an oracle separation between BQP and BPP.\n",
      "In the Deutsch–Jozsa problem, we are given a black box quantum computer known as an oracle that implements some function:                    \n",

      "For a conventional randomized algorithm, a constant εισon is sufficient to produce the correct answer with a high probability (failing with probability 1/2^{k}}, and a constant ϵ is sufficient for a high-probability evaluation of the function.

      "The algorithm was successful with a probability of one half.\n",
      "In 1992, Deutsch and Jozsa produced a deterministic algorithm which was generalized to a function which takes                                     ( n ) as input for its input and n (                  ) as its output.The algorithm takes n bits for its output and                  n ( n {\\displaystyle n} ( n} ) as a constant number of                 s for its inputs\n",
      "Unlike Deutsch's algorithm, this algorithm required two function evaluations instead of only one.\n",

      "He was described in an obituary by the Conservative journalist Patrick Cosgrave as \"Between Harold Wilson and Tony Blair, the only possible Labour Party leader of whom a Conservative leader had cause to walk in fear\" and, along with Enoch Powell, \"the most captivating rhetorician of the age\".\n",
      "Born in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, Shore was the son of a Merchant Navy captain and was brought up in a middle-class environment.== Early life ==\n",
      "He attended Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool and, from there, went to King's College, Cambridge, to read History as an exhibitioner, where he was a member of the Cambridge Apostles, a secret society with an elite membership.\n",
      "During the later stages of World War II he served in the Royal Air Force, spending most of his time in India.\n",
      "He had specialised in political economy during part of his degree and joined the Labour Party in 1948.== Political career ==\n",
      "He spent the 1950s working for the party and, after two unsuccessful Parliamentary contests at St Ives in 1950 and Halifax in 1959, he was appointed as Head of the Labour Party's Research Department and took charge of the renewal of party policy following its third successive defeat in 1959.\n",
      "Shore was only briefly a follower of Hugh Gaitskell; his adherence to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament from 1958 led to a breach in relations for several years.He became close to Harold Wilson after Wilson had been elected as party leader, and was the main author of the Labour Party manifesto for the 1964 general election.\n",
      "At the last minute, he was selected to fight the safe seat of Stepney in the election which he easily won.After only a short spell on the backbenches, Wilson chose Shore to be Parliamentary Private Secretary, responsible for liaising between the Prime Minister and Labour MPs, though Denis Healey termed him \"Harold's lapdog\".\n",
      "Shore was responsible for drafting the 1966 and 1970 election manifestos.\n",
      "Shore's job as Wilson's PPS kept them in close contact and in August 1967, Shore became a member of the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Economic Affairs.\n",
      "This Department had been created by Wilson to undertake long-term planning of the economy.=== In government ===\n",
      "Shore declared immediately his belief in state-controlled economic planning, together with the regulation of prices and wages.\n",
      "Early in 1968, the responsibility for prices and incomes was transferred to another department.\n",
      "The Treasury had never approved of the creation of the Department for Economic Affairs and began reasserting its influence, depriving it of any significant power.\n",
      "The department was wound up in October 1969.\n",
      "At the same time, Shore sided with those in cabinet who were opposed to Barbara Castle's White Paper, In Place of Strife.\n",
      "In a conversation with Richard Crossman at the time, Wilson was frustrated with Shore: \"I over-promoted him.\n",
      "He's no good\".Shore was retained in the Cabinet as a Minister without Portfolio and Deputy Leader of the House of Commons.\n",
      "He played a key part, behind the scenes, in planning the Labour Party's unsuccessful 1970 general election campaign.\n",
      "In opposition, Shore was appointed as spokesman on Europe, taking the lead in opposing Edward Heath's application to join the European Economic Community.\n",
      "Shore had already become convinced that membership of the EEC would be a disaster because it would stop the British government from taking necessary economic action.\n",
      "However, due to organisation by pro-EEC Labour backbenchers, Heath was able to steer his policy successfully through Parliament.\n",
      "When Wilson returned to government in 1974, Shore was appointed as Secretary of State for Trade.=== EEC ===\n",
      "His term in office was dominated by the renegotiation of the terms of British membership of the EEC, a pledge contained in the Labour manifesto as a preparation for a national referendum on membership; this compromise had reunited the Labour Party on the issue.\n",
      "Shore participated in the discussions without believing that any new terms would be acceptable, and during the referendum he joined with other anti-EEC politicians in opposing membership.\n",
      "The results of the 1975 Referendum, giving a two-to-one majority in favour of remaining a member of the EEC, damaged Shore along with the other 'dissenting ministers'.\n",
      "His inclination to support an autarkic economy ruled him out of consideration as a new Chancellor of the Exchequer, but Shore was moved to Secretary of State for the Environment by new Prime Minister James Callaghan in 1976.\n",
      "This move was a promotion but involved him in considerable political controversy.\n",
      "He called on local authorities to cut spending and waste, and criticised the trade unions representing local authority staff for failure to support modernisation.\n",
      "Shore also launched a campaign to revitalise the inner cities of Britain.\n",
      "Shore became a fervent advocate of the British nuclear deterrent for the last three decades of his life, but in 1958 he had been an active member of CND.=== Nuclear deterrent ===\n",
      "In his 1966 book Entitled to Know, he was critical of the Nassau Agreement with the United States under which Britain's nuclear submarines were, except in a national emergency, permanently assigned to NATO.\n",
      "For if such a policy is like General de Gaulle's, based upon a deliberate and far-reaching politico-military strategy of national independence, past disengagement from NATO and détente in Europe, it merits the most careful examination.Regarding dependence on NATO as limiting Britain's freedom of action, Shore negatively compared Britain's nuclear strategy to that of France:\n",
      "But, of these broader aims, there was not a whisper or suggestion from Tory Ministers.\n",
      "...after the cancellation of Blue Streak...that, failing the development of a major new British weapons system, we hadn't, and could not in future possess, a genuine independent nuclear capacity.\n",
      "Shore had always been implacably opposed to any suggestion of British participation in the Vietnam war, both as PPS and in Cabinet he had encouraged Wilson to distance himself more explicitly from American foreign policy.\n",
      "By the mid-1970s, while continuing to condemn American foreign policy in Vietnam and Chile, he had become more supportive of NATO and the United States.\n",
      "When the Labour Party went into opposition in 1979, Shore was made Shadow Foreign Secretary, having recanted on his previous support for CND.=== Labour leadership candidate ===\n",
      "He was persuaded to stand as a candidate in the election of a new party leader in November 1980 by Michael Foot who thought he was the best-placed soft-left candidate to defeat Denis Healey.\n",
      "However, Shore came bottom of the poll with 32 votes when Foot was himself persuaded to stand.\n",
      "Foot then made him Shadow Chancellor where his support for interventionist measures met with Foot's approval; party policy also became opposed to EEC membership, which suited Shore well.\n",
      "In the early 1980s, Shore's patriotic tendencies were again evident when he first of all strongly opposed the Conservative Government's attempts to hand over the Falkland Islands to Argentina and then supported Margaret Thatcher in the Falklands War of 1982.\n",
      "He fought for the leadership again after Foot resigned, but obtained a dismal vote of 3%, being unsupported by any Constituency Labour Party.=== Shadow Cabinet ===\n",
      "Shore served as Shadow Leader of the House of Commons for four years under Neil Kinnock but his influence with the leadership was negligible and he was not re-elected to the Shadow cabinet in 1985.\n",
      "He stood down from the front bench in 1987 and thereafter served on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, devoting himself to European Union questions.\n",
      "Edward Pearce wrote in his Guardian obituary of Shore that \"he had now become a right-wing figure, cluckingly approved of by Conservatives\".Tony Blair selected him as a senior Labour statesman as his nominee for the Committee on Standards in Public Life when it was set up in 1994.\n",
      "In contrast to Pearce's assertion that Shore had become a \"right-wing figure\", Chris Mullin quoted Shore in 1997 as saying: \"I still believe in state intervention, a good measure of equality, full employment.I still think the state should be involved in the economy and in the welfare state.I think it is important to have a good balance between the state and the private sector.=== Backbenches, retirement and death ===After several attempts in his constituency party\n",
      "Mullin described Shore as alienated from New Labour, and quoted his criticism: \"I like Tony Blair.\n",
      "I think he is probably right about wanting to put a certain distance between the party and the unions, but I’m offended by New Labour’s constant repudiation of our past.\n",
      "\"His book Separate Ways (2000) advocated a multi-speed Europe with some countries as merely associate members, so as to allow the centre to forge a political union at its own pace.\n",
      "He died in 2001, aged 77.\n",
      "On 27 September 1948, Shore married Dr Elizabeth Catherine Wrong, daughter of the historian Edward Murray Wrong.== Family ==\n",
      "Known as Liz, she was the Deputy Chief Medical Officer of England from 1977 to 1985 and in this role and later positions she championed women's career progression in medicine.\n",
      "They had two daughters, Thomasina and Tacy, both retired teachers, and two sons, Crispin, who is Professor of Social Anthropology at Goldsmiths, University of London, and Piers, who died in 1977.\n",
      "Elizabeth Catherine Wrong Shore died in 2022.\n"

      "In physics, energy (from Ancient Greek  ἐνέργεια (enérgeia ) 'activity') is the quantitative property that is transferred to a body or to a physical system, recognizable in the performance of work and in the form of heat and light.\n",
      "Energy is a conserved quantity—the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed.\n",
      "The unit of measurement for energy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule (J).\n",
      "Common forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the potential energy stored by an object (for instance due to its position in a field), the elastic energy stored in a solid object, chemical energy associated with chemical reactions, the radiant energy carried by electromagnetic radiation, and the internal energy contained within a thermodynamic system.\n",
      "All living organisms constantly take in and release energy.\n",
      "Due to mass–energy equivalence, any object that has mass when stationary (called rest mass ) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called rest energy and any additional energy (of any form) acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object's total mass just as it increases its total energy.\n",
      "Human civilization requires energy to function, which it gets from energy resources such as fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, or renewable energy.\n",
      "The Earth's climate and ecosystems processes are driven by the energy the planet receives from the Sun (although a small amount is also contributed by geothermal energy).\n",
      "The total energy of a system can be subdivided and classified into potential energy, kinetic energy, or combinations of the two in various ways.== Forms ==\n",
      "Kinetic energy is determined by the movement of an object – or the composite motion of the components – and potential energy reflects the potential to have motion and generally is a function of the position of the object within a field or may be stored in the field itself.\n",
      "While these two categories are sufficient to describe all forms of energy, it is often convenient to refer to particular combinations of potential and kinetic energy as its own form.\n",
      "For example, the sum of translational and rotational kinetic and potential energy within a system is referred to as mechanical energy, whereas nuclear energy refers to the combined potentials within an atomic nucleus from either the nuclear force or the weak force, among other examples.\n",
      "The word energy derives from the Ancient Greek: ἐνέργεια, romanized: energeia, lit.“energy” or “power”.\n",
      "'activity, operation', which possibly appears for the first time in the work of Aristotle in the 4th century BC.\n",
      "In contrast to the modern definition, energeia was a qualitative philosophical concept that was broad enough to include ideas such as happiness and pleasure.\n",
      "In the late 17th century, Gottfried Leibniz proposed the idea of the Latin: vis viva, or living force, which defined as the product of the mass of an object and its velocity squared; he believed that total viva was conserved.\n",
      "To account for slowing due to friction, Leibniz theorized that thermal energy consisted of the motions of the constituent parts of matter, although it would be more than a century until this was generally accepted.\n",
      "The modern analog of this property, kinetic energy, differs from vis viva only by a factor of two.\n",
      "The concept of conservation of energy was proposed by Émilie du Châtelet in the marginalia of her French language translation of Newton's Principia Mathematica, which represented the first formulation of a conserved measurable quantity that was distinct from momentum and which would later be called \"energy\".\n",
      "In 1807, Thomas Young was possibly the first to use the term \"energy\" instead of vis viva, in its modern sense.\n",
      "Gustave-Gaspard Coriolis described \"kinetic energy\" in 1829 in its modern sense and in 1853, William Rankine coined the term \"potential energy\".\n",
      "The law of conservation of energy was also first postulated in the early 19th century and applies to any isolated system.\n",
      "It was argued for some years whether heat was a physical substance, dubbed the caloric, or merely a physical quantity, such as momentum.\n",
      "In 1845 James Prescott Joule discovered the link between mechanical work and the generation of heat.\n",
      "These developments led to the theory of conservation of energy, formalized largely by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) as the field of thermodynamics.\n",
      "Thermodynamics aided the rapid development of explanations of chemical processes by Rudolf Clausius, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and Walther Nernst.\n",
      "It also led to a mathematical formulation of the concept of entropy by Clausius and to the introduction of laws of radiant energy by Jožef Stefan.\n",
      "According to Noether's theorem, the conservation of energy is a consequence of the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.\n",
      "The law of conservation of energy is the direct mathematical consequence of the translational symmetry of the quantity conjugate to energy, namely time.\n",
      "In 1843, James Prescott Joule independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments.== Units of measure ==\n",
      "The most famous of them used the \"Joule apparatus\": a descending weight, attached to a string, caused rotation of a paddle immersed in water, practically insulated from heat transfer.\n",
      "It showed that the gravitational potential energy lost by the weight in descending was equal to the internal energy gained by the water through friction with the paddle.\n",
      "In the International System of Units (SI), the unit of energy is the joule, named after Joule.\n",
      "It is a derived unit.\n",
      "It is equal to the energy expended (or work done) in applying a force of one newton through a distance of one metre.\n",
      "Energy is expressed in many other units not part of the SI, such as ergs, calories, British thermal units, kilowatt-hours and kilocalories, which require a conversion factor when expressed in SI units.\n",
      "The SI unit of energy rate (energy per unit time) is the watt, which is a joule per second.\n",
      "One joule is one watt-second, and 3600 joules equal one Watt-hour.\n",
      "The CGS energy unit is the erg and the imperial and US customary units is the foot pound.\n",
      "Other energy units such as the electronvolt, food calorie or thermodynamic kcal (based on the temperature change of water in a heating process ) are used in specific areas of science and commerce.\n",
      "In classical mechanics, energy is a conceptually and mathematically useful property, as it is a conserved quantity.== Scientific use ===== Classical mechanics ===\n",
      "Several formulations of mechanics have been developed using energy as a core concept.\n",
      "Work is a function of energy, is force times distance.\n",
      "W = ∫ ∫ ( ∫, C, F ), C = ∶ ( ∶, C ), F = ∷ ( ∼C, F, G ), G = ∳ ( ∼F, G, G ( ∼G ), W = ∂ C, C. This says that the work of the work (,,, W ) is equal to the line integral of the force F along a path C; for details see\n",
      "Work and thus energy is frame dependent.\n",
      "For example, consider a ball being hit by a bat.\n",
      "In the center-of-mass reference frame, the bat does no work on the ball.\n",
      "But, in the reference frame of the person swinging the bat, considerable work is done on the ball.\n",
      "The total energy of a system is sometimes called the Hamiltonian, after William Rowan Hamilton.\n",
      "The classical equations of motion can be written in terms of the Hamiltonian, even for highly complex or abstract systems.\n",
      "These classical equations have remarkably direct analogs in nonrelativistic quantum mechanics.Another energy-related concept is called the Lagrangian, after Joseph-Louis Lagrange.\n",
      "This formalism is as fundamental as the Hamiltonian and both can be used to derive the equations of motion or be derived from them.\n",
      "It was invented in the context of classical mechanics but is generally useful in modern physics.\n",
      "The Lagrangian is defined as the kinetic energy minus the potential energy.\n",
      "The Lagrange formalism is mathematically more convenient than the Hamiltonian for non-conservative systems (such as systems with friction).\n",
      "Noether's theorem (1918) states that any differentiable symmetry of the action of a physical system has a corresponding conservation law.\n",
      "Noether's theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern theoretical physics and the calculus of variations.\n",
      "A generalisation of the seminal formulations on constants of motion in Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics (1788 and 1833), it does not apply to systems that cannot be modeled with a Lagrangians; for example, dissipative systems with continuous symmetries need not have a corresponding conservation law.\n",
      "In the context of chemistry, energy is an attribute of a substance as a consequence of its atomic, molecular or aggregate structure.\n",
      "Since a chemical transformation is accompanied by a change in one or more of these kinds of structure, it is usually accompanied by an increase in the total energy of the substances involved.\n",
      "Some energy may be transferred between the surroundings and the reactants in the form of heat or light; thus the products of a reaction have sometimes more but usually less energy than the reactions themselves.\n",
      "A reaction is said to be exothermic or exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the less common case of endothermic reactions the situation is the reverse.\n",
      "Chemical reactions are usually not possible unless the reactants surmount an energy barrier known as the activation energy.\n"

      "Other popular stadium sports include gridiron football, baseball, cricket, the various codes of rugby, field lacrosse, bandy and bullfighting.\n",
      "Many large sports venues are also used for concerts.\n",
      "Stadium is the Latin form of the Greek word \"stadion\" (στάδιον), a measure of length equalling the length of 600 human feet.== Etymology ==\n",
      "As feet are of variable length the exact length of a stadion depends on the exact lengths adopted for 1 foot at a given place and time.\n",
      "Although in modern terms 1 stadion = 600 ft (180 m), in a given historical context it may actually signify a length up to 15% larger or smaller.The equivalent Roman measure, the stadium, had a similar length – about 185 m (607 ft) – but instead of being defined in feet it was defined using the Roman standard passus to be a distance of 125 passūs (double-paces).\n",
      "The English use of stadium comes from the tiered infrastructure surrounding a Roman track of such length.\n",
      "Most dictionaries provide for both stadiums and stadia as valid English plurals.\n",
      "The oldest known stadium is the Stadium at Olympia in Greece, where the ancient Olympic Games were held from 776 BC.== History ==\n",
      "Initially the Games consisted of a single event, a sprint along the length of the stadium.\n",
      "Greek and Roman stadiums have been found in numerous ancient cities, perhaps the most famous being the Stadium of Domitian in Rome.\n",
      "The excavated and refurbished ancient Panathenaic Stadium hosted attempted revivals of the Olympic Games in 1870 and 1875 before hosting the first modern Olympics in 1896, the 1906 Intercalated Games and some events of the 2004 Summer Olympics.\n",
      "The excavation and refurbishment of the stadium was part of the legacy of the Greek national benefactor Evangelos Zappas and it was the first ancient stadium to be used in modern times.\n",
      "Stadiums in ancient Greece and Rome were built for different purposes and at first only the Greeks built structures called \"stadium\"; Romans built structures named \"circus\".=== Antiquity ===\n",
      "Greek stadia were for foot races, whereas the Roman circus was for horse races.\n",
      "Both had similar shapes and bowl-like areas around them for spectators.\n",
      "The Greeks also developed the theatre, with its seating arrangements foreshadowing those of modern stadiums.\n",
      "The Romans copied the theatre, then expanded it to accommodate larger crowds and more elaborate settings.\n",
      "The Romans also developed the double-sized round theatre called amphitheatre, seating crowds in the tens of thousands for gladiatorial combats and beast shows.\n",
      "The Greek stadium and theatre and the Roman circus and amphitheatre are all ancestral to the modern stadium.\n",
      "The first stadiums to be built in the modern era were basic facilities, designed for the single purpose of fitting as many spectators in as possible.==== Examples ==== Basic facilities ==== Modernity ===\n",
      "With tremendous growth in the popularity of organised sport in the late Victorian era, especially association football in the United Kingdom and baseball in America, the first such structures were built.\n",
      "One such early stadium was the Lansdowne Road Stadium, the brainchild of Henry Dunlop, who organised the first All Ireland Athletics Championships.\n",
      "Banned from locating sporting events at Trinity College, Dunlop built the stadium in 1872.\n",
      "\"I laid down a cinder running path of a quarter-mile, laid down the present Lansdowne Tennis Club ground with my own theodolite, started a tennis club, a cricket club and a rugby club, and last but not least, the first Rugby Football Club – colours red, black and yellow.\"\n",
      "Some 300 cartloads of soil from a trench beneath the railway were used to raise the ground, allowing Dunlop to use his engineering expertise to create a pitch envied around Ireland.\n",
      "Other early stadiums from this period in the UK include the Stamford Bridge stadium (opened in 1877 for the London Athletic Club) and Anfield stadium (1884 as a venue for Everton F.C.).\n",
      "In the U.S., many professional baseball teams built large stadiums mainly out of wood with the first such venue being the South End Grounds in Boston, opened in 1871 for the team then known as the Boston Beaneaters (now the Atlanta Braves).\n",
      "Many of these parks caught fire, and those that did not proved inadequate for a growing game.\n",
      "All of the 19th-century wooden parks were replaced, some after a few years and none survive today.\n",
      "Goodison Park was the first purpose-built association football stadium in the world.\n",
      "Walton-based building firm Kelly brothers were instructed to erect two uncovered stands that could each accommodate 4,000 spectators.\n",
      "A third covered stand accommodating 3,000 spectators was also requested.\n",
      "Everton officials were impressed with the builder's workmanship and agreed two further contracts: exterior hoardings were constructed at a cost of £150 and 12 turnstiles were installed at £7 each.\n",
      "The stadium was officially opened on 24 August 1892 by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the Football Association.\n",
      "No football was played; instead the 12,000 crowd watched a short track and field event followed by music and a fireworks display.\n",
      "The architect Archibald Leitch brought his experience with the construction of industrial buildings to bear on the design of functional stadiums up and down the country.Upon its completion the stadium was the first joint purpose-built football stadium in the world.\n",
      "His work encompassed the first 40 years of the 20th century.\n",
      "One of his most notable designs was Old Trafford in Manchester.\n",
      "The ground was originally designed with a capacity of 100,000 spectators and featured seating in the south stand under cover, while the remaining three stands were left as terraces and uncovered.\n",
      "It was the first stadium to feature continuous seating along the contours of the stadium.These early venues were adopted for use by the Olympic Games, the first one being held in 1896 in Athens, Greece.\n",
      "The White City Stadium, built for the 1908 Summer Olympics in London is often cited as the first modern seater stadium, at least in the UK.\n",
      "Designed by the engineer J.J. Webster and completed in 10 months by George Wimpey, on the site of the Franco-British Exhibition, this stadium with a seating capacity of 68,000 was opened by King Edward VII on 27 April 1908.\n",
      "Upon completion, the stadium had a running track 24 ft wide (7.3 m) and three laps to the mile (536 m); outside there was a 35-foot-wide (11 m), 660-yard (600 m) cycle track.\n",
      "The infield included a swimming and diving pool.\n",
      "The London Highbury Stadium was the first stadium in the UK to feature a two-tiered seating arrangement when it was redesigned in the Art Deco style in 1936.During these decades, parallel stadium developments were taking place in the U.S.\n",
      "The Baker Bowl, a baseball park in Philadelphia that opened in its original form in 1887 but was completely rebuilt in 1895, broke new ground in stadium construction in two major ways.\n",
      "The stadium's second incarnation featured the world's first cantilevered second deck (tier) in a sports venue and was the first baseball park to use steel and brick for the majority of its construction.\n",
      "Another influential venue was Boston's Harvard Stadium, built in 1903 by Harvard University for its American football team and track and field program.\n",
      "It was the world's first stadium to use concrete-and-steel construction.\n",
      "In 1909, concrete-and-steel construction came to baseball with the opening of Shibe Park in Philadelphia and, a few months later, Forbes Field in Pittsburgh.\n",
      "The latter was the world's first three-tiered sporting venue.\n",
      "The opening of these parks marked the start of the \"jewel box\" era of park construction.\n",
      "The largest stadium crowd ever was 199,854 people watching the final match of the 1950 World Cup at Rio de Janeiro's Maracanã on 16 July 1950.\n",
      "Domed stadiums are distinguished from conventional stadiums by their enclosing roofs.== Types ==\n",
      "Many of these are not actually domes in the pure architectural sense, some being better described as vaults, some having truss-supported roofs and others having more exotic designs such as a tensegrity structure.\n",
      "But, in the context of sports stadiums, the term \"dome\" has become standard for all covered stadiums, particularly because the first such enclosed stadium, the Houston Astrodome, was built with an actual dome-shaped roof.\n",
      "Some stadiums have partial roofs, and a few have even been designed to have moveable fields as part of the infrastructure.\n",
      "The Caesars Superdome in New Orleans is a true dome structure made of a lamellar multi-ringed frame and has a diameter of 680 feet (210 m).\n",
      "It is the largest fixed domed structure in the world.Even though enclosed, dome stadiums are called stadiums because they are large enough for outdoor sports such as athletics, American football, association football, rugby, and baseball.\n",
      "Arenas are large arenas designed for what are usually indoor sports like basketball, ice hockey and volleyball are generally called arenas.\n",
      "Exceptions include:Cameron Indoor Stadium, home to Duke University's Blue Devils men's and women's basketball programs.\n",

      "In the first resort, the risk is that of the lender and includes lost principal and interest, disruption to cash flows and increased collection costs.\n",
      "The loss may be complete or partial.\n",
      "In an efficient market, higher levels of credit risk will be associated with higher borrowing costs.\n",
      "Because of this, measures of borrowing costs such as yield spreads can be used to infer credit risk levels based on assessments by market participants.\n",
      "Losses can arise in a number of circumstances, for example:A consumer may fail to make a payment due on a mortgage loan, credit card, line of credit, or other loan.\n",

      "An insolvent insurance company does not pay a policy obligation.\n",
      "An insolvent bank will not return funds to a depositor.\n",
      "To reduce the lender's credit risk, the lender may perform a credit check on the prospective borrower, may require the borrower to take out appropriate insurance, such as mortgage insurance, or seek security over some assets of the borrower or a guarantee from a third party.A government grants bankruptcy protection to an insolvent consumer or business.\n",
      "The lender can also take out insurance against the risk or on-sell the debt to another company.\n",
      "In general, the higher the risk, the higher will be the interest rate that the debtor will be asked to pay on the debt.\n",
      "Credit risk mainly arises when borrowers are unable or unwilling to pay.\n",
      "A credit risk can be of the following types:Credit default risk – The risk of loss arising from a debtor being unlikely to pay its loan obligations in full or the debtor is more than 90 days past due on any material credit obligation; default risk may impact all credit-sensitive transactions, including loans, securities and derivatives.== Types ==\n",
      "Concentration risk – The risk associated with any single exposure or group of exposures with the potential to produce large enough losses to threaten a bank's core operations.\n",
      "It may arise in the form of single-name concentration or industry concentration.\n",
      "Country risk – The risk of loss arising from a sovereign state freezing foreign currency payments (transfer/conversion risk) or when it defaults on its obligations (sovereign risk); this type of risk is prominently associated with the country's macroeconomic performance and its political stability.\n",
      "Significant resources and sophisticated programs are used to analyze and manage risk.== Assessment ==\n",
      "Some companies run a credit risk department whose job is to assess the financial health of their customers and extend credit (or not) accordingly.\n",

      "They also use the third party provided intelligence.\n",
      "Nationally recognized statistical rating organizations provide such information for a fee.\n",
      "For large companies with liquidly traded corporate bonds or Credit Default Swaps, bond yield spreads and credit default swap spreads indicate market participants assessments of credit risk and may be used as a reference point to price loans or trigger collateral calls.\n",

      "With products such as unsecured personal loans or mortgages, lenders charge a higher price for higher-risk customers and vice versa.\n",
      "With revolving products such as credit cards and overdrafts, the risk is controlled through the setting of credit limits.\n",
      "Credit scoring models also form part of the framework used by banks or lending institutions to grant credit to clients.Some products also require collateral, usually an asset that is pledged to secure the repayment of the loan.\n",
      "For corporate and commercial borrowers, these models generally have qualitative and quantitative sections outlining various aspects of the risk including, but not limited to, operating experience, management expertise, asset quality and leverage and liquidity ratios, respectively.\n",

      "The likelihood of rescheduling is a decreasing function of investment ratio due to future economic productivity gains.\n",

      "because of temporary liquidity issues or longer-term systemic reasons.\n",
      "The capital requirement here is calculated using SA-CCR, the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk.Further, counterparty risk increases due to positively correlated risk factors; accounting for this correlation between portfolio risk factors and counterparty default in risk management methodology is not trivial.\n",
      "This framework replaced both non-internal model approaches  -  Current Exposure Method (CEM) and Standardised Method (SM).\n",

      "Covenants – Lenders may write stipulations on the borrower, called covenants, into loan agreements such as:Periodically report its financial condition,Refrain from paying dividends, repurchasing shares, borrowing further, or other specific, voluntary actions that negatively affect the company's financial position, andRepay the loan in full, at the lender's request, in certain events such as changes in the borrower's debt-to-equity ratio or interest coverage ratio.\n",

      "When the film medium came about in the 19th century, there already was a centuries old tradition of screening moving images through shadow play and the magic lantern that were very popular with audiences in many parts of the world.\n",
      "Especially the magic lantern influenced much of the projection technology, exhibition practices and cultural implementation of film.\n",
      "Between 1825 and 1840, the relevant technologies of stroboscopic animation, photography and stereoscopy were introduced.\n",
      "For much of the rest of the century, many engineers and inventors tried to combine all these new technologies and the much older technique of projection to create a complete illusion or a complete documentation of reality.\n",
      "Colour photography was usually included in these ambitions and the introduction of the phonograph in 1877 seemed to promise the addition of synchronized sound recordings.\n",
      "Between 1887 and 1894, the first successful short cinematographic presentations were established.\n",
      "The biggest popular breakthrough of the technology came in 1895 with the first projected movies that lasted longer than 10 seconds.\n",
      "During the first years after this breakthrough, most motion pictures lasted about 50 seconds, lacked synchronized sound and natural colour and were mainly exhibited as novelty attractions.\n",
      "In the first decades of the 20th century, movies grew much longer and the medium quickly developed into one of the most important tools of communication and entertainment.\n",
      "The breakthrough of synchronized sound occurred at the end of the 1920s and that of full color motion picture film in the 1930s (although black and white films remained very common for several decades).\n",

      "Television, video and video games are closely related technologies, but are traditionally seen as different media.\n",
      "Historically, they were often interpreted as threats to the movie industry that had to be countered with innovations in movie theatre screenings, such as colour, widescreen formats and 3D.\n",
      "The rise of new media and digitization have caused many aspects of different media to overlap with film, resulting in shifts in ideas about the definition of film.\n",

      "The term \"film\" mostly refers to relatively long and big productions that can be best enjoyed by large audiences on a large screen in a movie theatre, usually relating a story full of emotions, while the term \"video\" is mostly used for shorter, small-scale productions that seem to be intended for home viewing, or for instructional presentations to smaller groups.\n",
      "The technology of film emerged mostly from developments and achievements in the fields of projection, lenses, photography and optics.== From ancient times to 1894: motion picture technologies before film ==\n",
      "Early techniques that involve moving pictures and/or projection include:Shadowgraphy (probably in practice since prehistoric times )Camera obscura (a natural phenomenon that has possibly been used as an artistic aid in prehistoric times)Shadow puppetry (possibly originated around 200 BCE in Central Asia, India, Indonesia or China )Magic lantern (developed in the 1650s )stroboscopic \"persistence vision\" animation devices (phénakisticope since 1833, zoetro\n",
      "Very occasionally, the camera obscura was used to project theatrical spectacles to entertain small audiences.\n",
      "It is believed that the technique was more commonly used by charlatans, priests and wizards to conjure up magical, religious and necromantic appearances, for instance ghosts, gods or demons.\n",
      "The use of a lens in a camera obscura has been dated back to 1550.\n",
      "In the 17th century, the camera obscura was a popular drawing aid and commonly turned into a mobile device, first as tents and not much later as portable wooden boxes.\n",
      "Starting around 1790 with the experiments of Thomas Wedgwood, the box-type camera obscura would be adapted into a photographic still camera by capturing the projected images on plates or sheets that were treated with light-sensitive chemicals.\n",
      "Around 1659 the magic lantern was developed by Christiaan Huygens.\n",
      "It projected slides that were usually painted in color on glass.\n",
      "A sketch by Huygens believed to have been made in 1659, indicates that moving images from mechanical slides may have been part of the earliest screenings.\n",
      "Around 1790, the magic lantern became an important instrument in the multi-media phantasmagoria spectacles.\n",
      "Rear projection, animated slides, multiple projectors (superimposition), mobile projectors on tracks or handheld), projection on smoke, sounds, odors and even electric shocks were used to frighten audiences in dedicated theatres with a convincing ghost horror experience.\n",
      "In the 19th century, several other popular magic lantern techniques were developed, including dissolving views and new types of mechanical slides that created dazzling abstract effects (chromatrope, et cetera) or that depicted, for instance, falling snow or the planets and their moons revolving.\n",
      "Many aspects of cinema are closely related to theatre.\n",
      "The term \"photoplay\", commonly used in the early days of cinema, reflects the idea of motion pictures as filmed plays.\n",
      "Technologies used for the theatre, such as stage lighting and all kinds of special effects were automatically adopted for use in front of cameras.\n",
      "On 21 January 1831, Michael Faraday introduced an experiment with a rotating cardboard disc with concentric series of apertures that represented cogwheels of different sizes and different amounts of cogs.=== 1831–1848: Early stroboscopic animation ===\n",
      "When looking at a mirror through the holes of one series of apertures, that \"wheel\" seemed to stand still while the others would appear to move around with different velocities or in opposite directions.In January 1833, Joseph Plateau published a letter about his recently discovered slotted disc inspired by Faraday's input.\n",
      "The illustrated example of a pirouetting dancer demonstrated that if drawings of successive phases of a scene or object in motion replaced the apertures in Faraday's experiment, they would give the impression of fluent motion when viewed in the mirror through the slots.\n",
      "Plateau's Fantascope became better known as the Phénakisticope and its principle would form the basis for many later motion picture technologies (including cinematography).\n",
      "The possibilities of the Fantascope were limited to the short loops of images that could be drawn or printed on a cardboard circle, but Plateau suggested in a letter to Faraday that the principle might find modified applications in phantasmagoria.In May 1833, Simon Stampfer published his Stroboscopische Scheiben that were very similar to Plateau's Fantascopes.\n",
      "In a booklet issued later that year, he explained the stroboscopic animation principles and stated to have discovered the technique in December 1832 soon after repeating Faraday's experiments.\n",
      "Stampfer also suggested several variations, including a cylinder (similar to the later zoetrope), a long paper or canvas strip looped around two parallel rollers to enable longer theatre scenes (somewhat similar to film ) and a theater-like frame (much like the later praxinoscope theatre).\n",
      "Because most movements in nature could not be \"fixed in their individual moments\", Stampfer promoted careful analysis of motion and strict division into regular phases for accurate motion designs.\n",
      "In the April 1833 patent application for the stroboscope discs, Stampfer and publisher Matthias Trentsensky had also suggested stroboscopic presentation of transparent pictures (which were commonly used for magic lantern projection).\n",
      "The earliest known public screening of projected stroboscopic animation was presented by Austrian magician Ludwig Döbler on 15 January 1847 at the Josephstadt Theatre in Vienna with his patented Phantaskop.\n",
      "The spectacle was well-received with sold-out shows in several European cities during a tour that lasted until the spring of 1848, although one critic complained about the flickering quality of the stroboscopic images.\n",
      "When photography was introduced in 1839, long exposure times seemed to prohibit a combination with stroboscopic animation.=== 1849–1870: Photography in motion ===\n",
      "In 1849, Joseph Plateau published about improvements for his Fantascope, including a suggestion by Charles Wheatstone to combine it with his invention of the stereoscope and with inspiration from Wheatstone's early stereoscopic photography.\n",
      "Plateau proposed a stop motion technique avant la lettre with stereoscopic recordings of plaster models in different positions.\n",

      "The history of film chronicles the development of a visual art form created using film technologies that began in the late 19th century.\n",
      "The advent of film as an artistic medium is not clearly defined.\n",
      "However, the commercial, public screening of ten of the Lumière brothers' short films in Paris on 28 December 1895, can be regarded as the breakthrough of projected cinematographic motion pictures.\n",
      "There had been earlier cinematographic results and screenings by others, like the Skladanowsky brothers, who used their self-made Bioscop to display the first moving picture show to a paying audience on 1 November 1895, in Berlin, but they had neither the quality, financial backing, stamina or luck to find the momentum that propelled the cinématographe Lumière into worldwide success.\n",
      "Those earliest films were in black and white, under a minute long, without recorded sound and consisted of a single shot from a steady camera.\n",
      "The first decade of motion pictures saw film move from a novelty to an established mass entertainment industry with film production companies and studios established all over the world.\n",
      "Conventions toward a general cinematic language also developed, with film editing camera movements and other cinematic techniques contributing specific roles in the narrative of films.\n",
      "Popular new media, including television (mainstream since the 1950s), home video and the 1980s, and the internet, influenced the distribution and consumption of films.\n",
      "Film production usually responded with content to fit the new media and with technical innovations (including widescreen (mainstream since the 1950s), 3D and 4D film ) and more spectacular films to keep theatrical screenings attractive.\n",
      "Systems that were cheaper and more easily handled (including 8mm film, video and smartphone cameras ) allowed for an increasing number of people to create films of varying qualities, for any purpose (including home movies and video art).\n",
      "The technical quality was usually lower than that of professional movies, but improved with digital video and affordable, high-quality digital cameras.\n",
      "Improving over time, digital production methods became more and more popular during the 1990s, resulting in increasingly realistic visual effects and popular feature-length computer animations.\n",
      "Various film genres emerged and enjoyed variable degrees of success over time, with huge differences among, for instance, horror.\n",
      "The use of film as an art form traces its origins to several earlier traditions in the arts such as (oral) storytelling, literature, theatre and visual arts.== Precursors ==\n",
      "Cantastoria and similar ancient traditions combined storytelling with series of images that were shown or indicated one after the other.\n",
      "Predecessors to film that had already used light and shadows to create art before the advent of modern film technology include shadowgraphy, shadow puppetry, camera obscura and the magic lantern.\n",
      "Shadowgraphy and shadow puppetry represent early examples of the intent to use moving imagery for entertainment and storytelling.\n",
      "Thought to have originated in the Far East, the art form used shadows cast by hands or objects to assist in the creation of narratives.\n",
      "Shadow puppetry enjoyed popularity for centuries around Asia, notably in Java and eventually spread to Europe during the Age of Enlightenment.By the 16th century, entertainers often conjured images of ghostly apparitions, using techniques such as camera obscura and other forms of projection to enhance their performances.\n",
      "Magic lantern shows developed in the latter half of the 17th century seem to have continued this tradition with images of death, monsters and other scary figures.\n",
      "Around 1790, this practice was developed into a type of multimedia ghost show known as phantasmagoria.\n",
      "These popular shows entertained audiences using mechanical slides, rear projection, mobile projectors, superimposition, dissolves, live actors, smoke (on which projections may have been cast), odors, sounds and even electric shocks.\n",
      "While many first magic lantern shows were intended to frighten viewers, advances by projectionists allowed for creative and even educational storytelling that could appeal to wider family audiences.\n",
      "Newly pioneered techniques such as the use of dissolving views and the chromatrope allowed for smoother transitions between two projected images and aided in providing stronger narratives.In 1833, scientific study of a stroboscopic illusion in spoked wheels by Joseph Plateau, Michael Faraday and Simon Stampfer led to the invention of the Fantascope, also known as the stroboscope disk or the phenakistiscope, which was popular in several European countries for a while.\n",
      "Plateau thought it could be further developed for use in phantasmagoria and Stampfer imagined a system for longer scenes with strips on rollers as well as a transparent version (probably intended for projection).\n",
      "Plateau, Charles Wheatstone, Antoine Claudet and others tried to combine the technique with the stereoscope (introduced in 1838) and photography for a more complete illusion of reality, but for decades such experiments were mostly hindered by the need for long exposure times and motion blur around objects that moved while the reflected light fell on the photo-sensitive chemicals.\n",
      "A few people managed to get decent results from stop motion techniques but these were only very rarely marketed and no form of animated photography had much cultural impact before the advent of chronophotography.\n",
      "Most early photographic sequences were not initially intended to be viewed in motion and were typically presented as a serious, even scientific, method of studying locomotion.\n",
      "The sequences almost exclusively involved humans or animals performing a simple movement in front of the camera.\n",
      "Starting in 1878 with the publication of The Horse in Motion cabinet cards, photographer Eadweard Muybridge began making hundreds of chronophotographic studies of the motion of animals and humans in real-time.\n",
      "He was soon followed by other chronophotographers like Étienne-Jules Marey, Georges Demenÿ, Albert Londe and Ottomar Anschütz.\n",
      "In 1879, Muybridge started lecturing on animal locomotion and used his Zoopraxiscope to project animations of the contours of his recordings, traced onto glass discs.In 1887, the German inventor and photographer Ottomar Anschütz started presenting his chronophotographic recordings in motion using a device he called the Elektrischen Schnellseher (also known as the Electrotachyscope ) which displayed short loops on a small\n",
      "By 1891, he had started mass production of a more economical, coin-operated peep-box viewing device of the same name that was exhibited at international exhibitions and fairs.\n",
      "Some machines were installed for longer periods, including some at The Crystal Palace in London and in several U.S. stores.\n",
      "Shifting the focus of the medium from technical and scientific interest in motion to entertainment for the masses, he recorded wrestlers, dancers, acrobats and scenes of everyday life.\n",
      "Nearly 34,000 people paid to see his shows at the Berlin Exhibition Park in summer 1892.\n",
      "Others saw it in London or at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair.Though little evidence remains for most of these recordings, some scenes probably depicted staged comical scenes.\n",
      "Advances towards motion picture projection technologies were based on the popularity of magic lanterns, chronophotographic demonstrations and other closely related forms of projected entertainment such as illustrated songs.Extant records suggest some of his output directly influenced later works by the Edison Company such as the 1894 film Fred Ott's Sneeze.\n",
      "From October 1892 to March 1900, inventor Émile Reynaud exhibited his Théâtre Optique (\"Optical Theatre\") film system at the Musée Grévin in Paris.\n",
      "Reynaud's device, which projected a series of animated stories such as Pauvre Pierrot and Autour d'une cabine, was displayed to over 500,000 visitors over the course of 12,800 shows.\n",
      "On 25, 29 and 30 November 1894, Ottomar Anschütz projected moving images from Electrotachyscope discs on a large screen in the darkened Grand Auditorium of a Post Office Building in Berlin.\n",
      "From 22 February to 30 March 1895, a commercial 1.5-hour program of 40 different scenes was screened for audiences of 300 people at the old Reichstag and received circa 4,000 visitors.\n",
      "In June 1889, American inventor Thomas Edison assigned a lab assistant, William Kennedy Dickson, to help develop a device that could produce visuals to accompany the sounds produced from the phonograph.== Novelty era (1890s – early 1900s) == Advances towards projection ===\n",
      "Building upon previous machines by Muybridge, Marey, Anschütz and others, Dickson and his team created the Kinetoscope peep-box viewer, with celluloid loops containing about half a minute of motion picture entertainment.\n",
      "After an early preview on 20 May 1891, Edison introduced the machine in 1893.\n",
      "Many of the movies presented on the Kinetoscope showcased well-known vaudeville acts performing in Edison's Black Maria studio.\n",
      "The Kinetoscope quickly became a global sensation with multiple viewing parlors across major cities by 1895.\n",
      "As the initial novelty of the images wore off, the Edison Company was slow to diversify their repertoire of films and waning public interest caused business to slow by Spring 1895.\n",
      "To remedy declining profits, experiments, such as The Dickson Experimental Sound Film were conducted in an attempt to achieve the device's original goal of providing visual accompaniment for sound recordings.\n",
      "Limitations in syncing the sound to the visuals, however, prevented widespread application.\n"

      "The Data Encryption Standard (DES ) is a symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of digital data.\n",
      "Although its short key length of 56 bits makes it too insecure for modern applications, it has been highly influential in the advancement of cryptography.\n",
      "Developed in the early 1970s at IBM and based on an earlier design by Horst Feistel, the algorithm was submitted to the National Bureau of Standards (NBS) following the agency's invitation to propose a candidate for the protection of sensitive, unclassified electronic government data.\n",
      "In 1976, after consultation with the National Security Agency (NSA), the NBS selected a slightly modified version (strengthened against differential cryptanalysis, but weakened against brute-force attacks ) which was published as an official Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for the United States in 1977.The publication of an NSA-approved encryption standard led to its quick international adoption and widespread academic scrutiny.\n",
      "Controversies arose from classified design elements, a relatively short key length of the symmetric-key block cipher design, and the involvement of the NSA, raising suspicions about a backdoor.\n",
      "The S-boxes that had prompted those suspicions were designed by the NSA to remove a backdoor they secretly knew (differential cryptanalysis).\n",
      "However, the NSA also ensured that the key size was drastically reduced so that they could break the cipher by brute force attack.\n",
      "The intense academic scrutiny the algorithm received over time led to the modern understanding of block ciphers and their cryptanalysis.\n",
      "DES is insecure due to the relatively short 56-bit key size.\n",
      "In January 1999, distributed.net and the Electronic Frontier Foundation collaborated to publicly break a DES key in 22 hours and 15 minutes (see § Chronology).\n",
      "There are also some analytical results which demonstrate theoretical weaknesses in the cipher, although they are infeasible in practice.\n",
      "The algorithm is believed to be practically secure in the form of Triple DES, although there are theoretical attacks.\n",
      "This cipher has been superseded by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).\n",
      "DES has been withdrawn as a standard by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.Some documents distinguish between the DES standard and its algorithm, referring to the algorithm as the DEA (Data Encryption Algorithm).\n",
      "The origins of DES date to 1972 when a National Bureau of Standards study of US government computer security identified a need for a government-wide standard for encrypting unclassified, sensitive information.Around the same time, engineer Mohamed Atalla in 1972 founded Atalla Corporation and developed the first hardware security module (HSM), the so-called \"Atalla Box\" which was commercialized in 1973.\n",
      "It protected offline devices with a secure PIN generating key, and was a commercial success.\n",
      "Banks and credit card companies were fearful that Atalla would dominate the market, which spurred the development of an international encryption standard.\n",
      "Atalla was an early competitor to IBM in the banking market and was cited as an influence by IBM employees who worked on the DES standard.\n",
      "The IBM 3624 later adopted a similar PIN verification system to the earlier Atalla system.On 15 May 1973, after consulting with the NSA, NBS solicited proposals for a cipher that would meet rigorous design criteria.\n",
      "None of the submissions was suitable.\n",
      "A second request was issued on 27 August 1974.\n",
      "This time, IBM submitted a candidate which was deemed acceptable—a cipher developed during the period 1973–1974 based on an earlier algorithm, Horst Feistel's Lucifer cipher.\n",
      "The team at IBM involved in cipher design and analysis included Feistel, Walter Tuchman, Don Coppersmith, Alan Konheim, Carl Meyer, Mike Matyas, Roy Adler, Edna Grossman, Bill Notz, Lynn Smith and Bryant Tuckerman.\n",
      "On 17 March 1975, the proposed DES was published in the Federal Register.=== NSA's involvement in the design ===\n",
      "Public comments were requested, and in the following year two open workshops were held to discuss the proposed standard.\n",
      "There was criticism received from public-key cryptography pioneers Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie, citing a shortened key length and the mysterious \"S-boxes\" as evidence of improper interference from the NSA.\n",
      "The suspicion was that the algorithm had been covertly weakened by the intelligence agency so that they—but no one else—could easily read encrypted messages.\n",
      "Alan Konheim (one of the designers of DES) commented, \"We sent the S-boxes off to Washington.\n",
      "They came back and were all different.\"\n",
      "The United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence reviewed the NSA's actions to determine whether there had been any improper involvement.\n",
      "In the unclassified summary of their findings, published in 1978, the Committee wrote:In the development of DES, NSA convinced IBM that a reduced key size was sufficient; indirectly assisted in the design of the S-box structures; and certified that the final DES algorithm was free from any statistical or mathematical weakness.\n",
      "However, it also found that NSA did not tamper with the design of the algorithm in any way.\n",
      "IBM invented and designed the algorithm, made all pertinent decisions regarding it, and concurred that the agreed upon key size was more than adequate for all commercial applications for which the DES was intended.\n",
      "Another member of the DES team, Walter Tuchman, stated \"We developed the DES algorithm entirely within IBM using IBMers.\n",
      "The NSA did not dictate a single wire!\"\n",
      "In contrast, a declassified NSA book on cryptologic history states:In 1973 NBS solicited private industry for a data encryption standard (DES).\n",
      "The first offerings were disappointing, so NSA began working on its own algorithm.\n",
      "Then Howard Rosenblum, deputy director for research and engineering, discovered that Walter Tuchman of IBM was working on a modification to Lucifer for general use.\n",
      "NSA gave Tuchman a clearance and brought him in to work jointly with the Agency on his Lucifer modification program.\n",
      "NSA worked closely with IBM to strengthen the algorithm against all except brute-force attacks and to strengthen substitution tables, called S-boxes.and to strengthen S-box-based substitution tables, called substitution tables.\n",
      "Conversely, NSA tried to convince IBM to reduce the length of the key from 64 to 48 bits.\n",
      "Ultimately they compromised on a 56-bit key.\n",
      "Some of the suspicions about hidden weaknesses in the S-boxes were allayed in 1990, with the independent discovery and open publication by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir of differential cryptanalysis, a general method for breaking block ciphers.\n",
      "The S-boxes of DES were much more resistant to the attack than if they had been chosen at random, strongly suggesting that IBM knew about the technique in the 1970s.\n",
      "This was indeed the case; in 1994, Don Coppersmith published some of the original design criteria for the S-boxes.\n",
      "According to Steven Levy, IBM Watson researchers discovered differential cryptanalytic attacks in 1974 and were asked by the NSA to keep the technique secret.\n",
      "Coppersmith explains IBM's secrecy decision by saying, \"that was because [differential cryptanalysis] can be a very powerful tool used against many schemes and there was concern that such information in the public domain could adversely affect national security.\"\n",
      "Levy quotes Walter Tuchman: \"[t]hey asked us to stamp all our documents confidential... We actually put a number on each one and locked them up in safes, because they were considered U.S. government classified.\n",
      "They said do it.\n",
      "So I did it\".\n",
      "Bruce Schneier observed that \"It took the academic community two decades to figure out that the NSA 'tweaks' actually improved the security of DES.\"\n",
      "Despite the criticisms, DES was approved as a federal standard in November 1976 and published on 15 January 1977 as FIPS PUB 46, authorized for use on all unclassified data.=== The algorithm as a standard ===\n",
      "It was subsequently reaffirmed as the standard in 1983, 1988 (revised as FIPS-46-1), 1993 (FIPS-45-2 ) and again in 1999, the latter prescribing \"Triple DES\" (see below).\n",
      "On 26 May 2002, DES was finally superseded by the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES ) following a public competition.\n",
      "On 19 May 2005, FIPS 46-3 was officially withdrawn, but NIST has approved Triple DES through the year 2030 for sensitive government information.The algorithm is also specified in ANSI X3.92 (Today X3 is known as INCITS and ANSIX3.92 as ANSI INCITS 92), NIST SP 800-67 and ISO/IEC 18033-3 (as a component of TDEA).\n",
      "Another theoretical attack, linear cryptanalysis, was published in 1994 but it was the Electronic Frontier Foundation's DES cracker in 1998 that demonstrated that DES could be attacked very practically and highlighted the need for a replacement algorithm.\n",
      "These and other methods of cryptanalysis are discussed in more detail later in this article.\n",
      "The introduction of DES is considered to have been a catalyst for the academic study of cryptography, particularly of methods to crack block ciphers.\n",
      "The DES can be said to have \"jump-started\" the nonmilitary study and development of encryption algorithms.According to a NIST retrospective about DES, the DES was the first nonmilitary encryption algorithm to be developed.\n",
      "In the 1970s there were very few cryptographers, except for those in military or intelligence organizations and little academic study of cryptography.\n",
      "There are now many active academic cryptologists, mathematics departments with strong programs in cryptography, and commercial information security companies and consultants.\n",
      "A generation of cryptanalysts has cut its teeth analyzing (that is, trying to \"crack\") the DES algorithm.\n",
      "In the words of cryptographer Bruce Schneier, \"DES did more to galvanize the field of cryptanalysis than anything else.\n",

      "When initially placed in contact with each other, some of the electrons in the n-type portion will flow into the p-type to \"fill in\" the missing electrons.\n",
      "Eventually enough will flow across the boundary to equalize the Fermi levels of the two materials.\n",
      "The result is a region at the interface, the p-n junction, where charge carriers are depleted on each side of the interface.\n",
      "When the material is placed in the sun, photons from the sun can be absorbed in the p-type side of the semiconductor, causing electrons in the valence band to be promoted in energy to the conduction band.In silicon, this transfer of electrons produces a potential barrier of about 0.6 V to 0.7 V.\n",
      "This process is known as photoexcitation.\n",
      "As the name implies, electrons in the conduction band are free to move about the semiconductor.\n",
      "When a load is placed across the cell as a whole, these electrons will flow from the p-type side into the n-type sides, lose energy while moving through the external circuit, and then go back into the material where they can re-combine with the valence-band holes they left behind.\n",
      "In this way, sunlight creates an electric current.\n",
      "The Shockley–Queisser limit is calculated by examining the amount of electrical energy that is extracted per photon of incoming sunlight.== The limit ==\n",
      "The black-body radiation effect is a phenomenon that occurs when any material that is not at absolute zero (0 Kelvin ) emits electromagnetic radiation through the black body radiation effect.There are several considerations:=== Blackbody radiation ===\n",
      "In a cell at room temperature, this represents approximately 7% of all the energy falling on the cell.\n",
      "Any energy lost in a cell is turned into heat, so any inefficiency in the cell increases the cell temperature when it is placed in sunlight.\n",
      "As the temperature of the cell increases, the outgoing radiation and heat loss through conduction and convection also increase, until an equilibrium is reached.\n",
      "In practice, this equilibrium is normally reached at temperatures as high as 360 Kelvin and consequently, cells normally operate at lower efficiencies than their room-temperature rating.\n",
      "Module datasheets normally list this temperature dependency as TNOCT (NOCT - Nominal Operating Cell Temperature).\n",
      "For a \"blackbody\" at normal temperatures, a very small part of this radiation (the number per unit time and per unit area given by Qc, \"c\" for \"cell\") is photons having energy greater than the band gap (wavelength less than about 1.1 microns for silicon), and part of these photons (Shockley and Queisser use the factor tc) are generated by recombination of electrons and holes, which decreases the amount of current that could\n",
      "This is a very small effect but Shockley and Queisser assume that the total rate of recombination (see below) when the voltage across the cell is zero (short circuit or no light ) is proportional to the blackbody radiation Qc.\n",
      "This rate of recombination plays a negative role in the efficiency.\n",
      "Shockley and Queisser calculate Qc to be 1700 photons per second per square centimetre for silicon at 300K.\n",
      "Absorption of a photon creates an electron-hole pair, which could potentially contribute to the current.=== Recombination ===\n",
      "The electron and a hole can meet and recombine, emitting a photon.However, the reverse process must also be possible, according to the principle of detailed balance: an electron and the hole can recombine and emit a photon\n",
      "This process reduces the efficiency of the cell.\n",
      "Other recombination processes may also exist (see \"Other considerations\" below ) but this one is absolutely required for the survival of the organism.\n",
      "In the Shockley–Queisser model, the recombination rate depends on the voltage across the cell but is the same whether or not there is light falling on the cell.\n",
      "A factor fc gives the ratio of recombination that produces radiation to total recombination in a given area, so the recombination per unit area when V = 0 is 2tcQc/fc and thus depends on Qc, the flux of blackbody photons above the band-gap energy.\n",
      "The factor of 2 was included on the assumption that radiation emitted by the cell goes in both directions.\n",
      "(This is actually debatable if a reflective surface is used on the shady side.)\n",
      "When the voltage is non-zero, the concentrations of charge carriers (electrons and holes ) change (see Shockley diode equation ) and according to the authors the rate of recombination changes by a factor of exp(V/Vc ), where Vc is the voltage equivalent of the temperature of the cell, or \"thermal voltage\", namely\n",
      "The rate of recombination, in this model, is proportional to exp(V/Vc) times the blackbody radiation above the band-gap energy: α ( V/vc ) times the band gap energy: β ( V ) times exp ( Vc ). In this model the recombination rate is proportional in this way to exp/vca times the frequency of blackbody recombination. The recombination rates are also proportional to the frequency at the band\n",
      "The cell is thick enough to act as a black body, to the more accurate expression, to be able to be described as a “black body”. This is actually an approximation, correct so long as the cell’s thickness is not too thick to be considered as black body.    ν,  𝕊𝕷𝕳𝕶𝕸𝕴𝕵𝕫�\n"
